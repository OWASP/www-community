# Source Code for Rendering UML for Diagrams

This directory is intended to contain the source code to generate the UML for diagrams such as flowcharts etc.

There's a Hitchhiker's Guide to PlantUML located at [https://crashedmind.github.io/PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide/](https://crashedmind.github.io/PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide/).

Please refer to the [PlantUML 'Beta' Activity Diagram syntax](https://plantuml.com/activity-diagram-beta) for the latest Activity Diagram syntax -- which was the syntax of the [Changing_Registered_Email_Address_For_An_Account.puml](/assets/images/controls/src/plantuml/Changing_Registered_Email_Address_For_An_Account.puml) file that was then rendered into [Changing_Registered_Email_Address_In_A_System_Flowchart.png](/assets/images/controls/Changing_Registered_Email_Address_In_A_System_Flowchart.png) for the [Changing Registered Email Address For An Account](/pages/controls/Changing_Registered_Email_Address_For_An_Account.html) page in the [Controls](/controls) section.
