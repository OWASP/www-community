# ISC - The Path to Becoming a Handler
Handlers¹ are volunteer professionals who generously donate their valuable time to detect and investigate incidents and 
anomalies arising from cyberattacks. Currently composed of [16 people](https://isc.sans.edu/handler_list.html), the Handlers 
regularly contribute on the topic by developing ideas, providing insights, or presenting real cases in an educational manner.

The journey to becoming a Handler is long, filled with challenges and discoveries. The [official roadmap](https://isc.sans.edu/handlerroadmap.html) 
contains detailed information about the process as well as the requirements to be met. Among them, we will highlight:

1. [GIAC Certification](http://www.giac.org/) or significant contribution in the field.

If you have no idea what the GIAC certification is about and have zero contributions to the community, don’t be discouraged, 
as every goal needs a starting point, and that’s the purpose of this initiative.

> we can increasingly protect our systems. Be ethical. Be responsible.

# Technical Requirements
It is of utmost importance that certain requirements are met to make the journey smoother and more understandable. Although 
not mandatory, it is highly recommended that you possess the following combination of skills and knowledge:

- Advanced programming experience (in any language);
- Proficiency in using the Linux operating system (any distribution);
- Understanding of protocols and networks (TCP, UDP, etc.);
- Autonomy in learning.

> **WARNING**: The roadmap does not aim to detail every aspect or tool used. Therefore, whenever you encounter the 🔍️ icon, 
> interpret it as an indication that understanding this item is crucial. It is highly recommended that you take your time, 
> without rushing, to fully grasp it before moving on. If you're here just out of curiosity, feel free to proceed without 
> hesitation.

>_**Note¹**: The term "Handlers" is used in this context because, in the web protocol, "Handlers" are interception points 
> where events occur, which can be observed, captured, or nullified._
