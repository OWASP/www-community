## ISC - The Handler Roadmap
The [Internet Storm Center (ISC)](https://isc.sans.edu/about.html) was created in 2001 after the successful detection, analysis, 
and widespread warning of the [Li0n](http://virus.wikidot.com/lion) worm. Today, the ISC provides a free analysis and alert 
service for thousands of Internet users and organizations, actively collaborating with Internet service providers to combat 
malicious attackers. The ISC collects millions of intrusion detection records daily, covering over 500,000 IP addresses in 
more than 50 countries, supported by the [SANS Institute](https://www.sans.org/about/).

The ISC is maintained by volunteers who donate their time to analyze and report security incidents, either through the
[DShield Sensor](https://isc.sans.edu/howto.html) or through their elevated knowledge, as a [Handler](https://isc.sans.edu/handler_list.html).

Now you can follow the path to become one of them. So [let's go!](isc_handler_roadmap/index.md)
