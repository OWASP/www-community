## List of Project Ideas

### [Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](https://owasp.org/www-project-bug-logging-tool/)

OWASP BLT is a _bug-hunting & logging_ tool which allows users and companies to hunt for bugs, claim bug bounties and also to start bug-hunting sprees/contests respectively. It is preferred if the potential GSoC contributors get at least 5 PRs merged for the project. Preference will be given to students
who get the most work done, and this is usually by submitting the most PRs.

##### 2024 GSOC Ideas / Projects

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas 

###### Test Suite Harmonization

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~175h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)

Juice Shop had a full replacement of its end-to-end test suite - from Protractor to Cypress - in its GSoC 2022 project. Now it is time to take on the remainin test suites, especially the Integration/API tests currently running on Frisby.js. That library as not seen updates in 2+ years and it became more and more flaky over the years, causing occasional CI/CD failures and time-consuming retry-mechanisms to keep those in check. A new foundation for these tests is needed. In scope is also to look at the frontend and backend unit test suites, and find a way to reduce the number of test frameworks being used in order to achieve higher consistency and less complexity for maintenance of the project.

###### Juice Shop CTF Tool Rennovation

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~175h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)

The Juice Shop CTF Tool is currently implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It should be migrated to TypeScript for consistency of maintenance with the main project. Furthermore, the code linting should be adapted to the main Juice Shop ESLint standards. Test coverage and relevance should be reviewed and strengthened where necessary.

### [OWASP secureCodeBox](https://www.securecodebox.io)

secureCodeBox is a kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project.
The secureCodeBox comes with many different scanners officially integrated (from Amass to Zap) and integration 
with vulnerability management backends like DefectDojo.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "securecodebox" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Add a secureCodeBox CLI (scbctl)

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-yellow)

The primary interface to interact with the secureCodeBox is through it's Custom Resources (CRs) in the Kubernetes API.
Writing the resource (e.g. [Scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/amass#examplecom)) is generally not hard but can be cumbersome as the require the creation of a new file / multi line string in the command line.

To make these interactions easier to use and more fun, a custom (but optional) secureCodeBox CLI should help by automatically connecting to the Kubernetes API.

- create a new command line client which connects to the Kubernetes API and interacts with the CRs of the secureCodeBox
- write tests & including integration / e2e test and the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

More context & information are listed in the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/issues/189)
