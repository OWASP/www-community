### [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://dsomm.owasp.org)

Join us in enhancing the DSOMM, a pivotal tool designed to improve the security and operational efficiency of software development processes. We are looking for passionate students to contribute to two major areas: our main application development in JavaScript and our metric analyzer and collector in Java. Whether you are looking to tackle medium-sized challenges or are ready to embark on a larger project, we have exciting opportunities for you.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "dsomm" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Medium Feature Pack for the DSOMM Main Application (JS)
![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
This pack includes tasks that are crucial for enhancing the user experience and functionality of the DSOMM main application. Contributors will address existing issues and add new features:
- Implement a **State or Tag for "Not yet assessed"**, addressing [Issue #241](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/241) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Enhance the **Excel download feature in "Mapping"** by adding assessment information, as discussed in [Issue #244](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/244#issuecomment-1811127472) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Refine the handling of **subcategories** to streamline the organization and presentation of maturity model elements, making the tool more intuitive. See [Issue #194](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/194) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Introduce the **Adding of Diagrams** feature to enhance the visualization of DevSecOps processes and maturity levels, as outlined in [Issue #183](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/183) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

##### Large Feature Pack for the metric Analyzer and Collector (Java)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-possible-yellow)
This pack challenges students to develop the entire workflow from data collection to visualization for DSOMM metrics, including the implementation of a Kafka queue. Projects include:
- Design and implement a **collector for OWASP DefectDojo**, fetching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) and Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) via the [defectdjo-client](https://github.com/SDA-SE/defectdojo-client) which fetches MTTR/MTTP) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Develop a **collector for Backstage and Confluence**, to retrieve essential documents such as threat modeling and pentest reports, with a focus on document management and identification. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Create a **collector for Jenkins**, aimed at measuring deployment frequency by team, a key metric in DevOps performance. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Engineer a **collector for GitHub**, to calculate MTTP by tracking pull request opening and merge dates. In addition, check that _branch protection_ is enabled and a .gitignore exists in the root file system. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

Please take a look at the [architecture digram of DSOMM metricCA](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/metricCA). The whole way from the collector to grafana needs to be implemented. Please note that a queue Kafka is currently not implemented and needs to be implemented in the collector and in the metricAnalyzer.

For Backstage and Confluence a defined format and tags might be used to identify the corresponding team and type of document (e.g. threat modeling/pentest).

#### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in the corresponding programming language (JavaScript for the main application, Java for the metric analyzer and collector)
- Previous contributions to open-source projects are highly desirable, demonstrating your commitment and collaborative skills

##### Mentors
Reach out to us on Slack to discuss these and other ideas!

### [OWASP secureCodeBox](https://www.securecodebox.io)

secureCodeBox is a kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project.
The secureCodeBox comes with many different scanners officially integrated (from Amass to Zap) and integration 
with vulnerability management backends like DefectDojo.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "securecodebox" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Rewrite DefectDojo Hook in Go(lang)

![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-yellow)

The current implementation of our [DefectDojo hook](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/hooks/persistence-defectdojo) is written in Java.
As the remainder of the project is written in Go & JavaScript the code does not fit into the remainder of the project and suffers from typical Java problems 
like a comparatively large memory footprint and slow boot times.

The goals of the project are:

- moving the implementation to a modern Go implementation
- extracting the DefectDojo api calls to reusable golang library
- expanding end-to-end testability of the hook with a real DefectDojo instance in the CI pipeline

###### Add a secureCodeBox CLI (scbctl)

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2024 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-yellow)

The primary interface to interact with the secureCodeBox is through it's Custom Resources (CRs) in the Kubernetes API.
Writing the resource (e.g. [Scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/amass#examplecom)) is generally not hard but can be cumbersome as the require the creation of a new file / multi line string in the command line.

To make these interactions easier to use and more fun, a custom (but optional) secureCodeBox CLI should help by automatically connecting to the Kubernetes API.

- create a new command line client which connects to the Kubernetes API and interacts with the CRs of the secureCodeBox
- write tests & including integration / e2e test and the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

More context & information are listed in the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/issues/189)
