## List of Project Ideas

### [Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](https://owasp.org/www-project-bug-logging-tool/)

OWASP BLT is a **bug-hunting & logging platform** that enables users to hunt for vulnerabilities, participate in bug bounties, and contribute to open-source security. Organizations can leverage BLT to manage vulnerability reports, track security issues, and engage with ethical hackers.  

BLT is a large-scale project with a growing ecosystem, offering **full-stack development, security automation, AI-powered analysis, and blockchain-based incentives**. This year’s GSoC projects focus on **UI/UX improvements, API development, automation, and gamification** to enhance the platform's usability and impact.  

> Preference will be given to students who have at least **5 merged PRs** before GSoC selection.

### [OWASP DevSecOps Maturity Model](https://dsomm.owasp.org)

Join us in enhancing the DSOMM, a pivotal tool designed to improve the security and operational efficiency of software development processes. We are looking for passionate students to contribute to two major areas: our main application development in JavaScript and our metric analyzer and collector in Java. Whether you are looking to tackle medium-sized challenges or are ready to embark on a larger project, we have exciting opportunities for you.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "dsomm" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Update of the DSOMM Application (Angular)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2026 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)
Primary Objectives:
- Upgrade Angular Framework: Migrate the DSOMM application from its current Angular version to Angular 21
- Updates: Update all related dependencies including TypeScript, RxJS, Angular CLI, and third-party libraries
- Code Modernization: Refactor deprecated APIs and adopt modern Angular patterns (standalone components, signals, etc.)
- Testing & Quality Assurance: Ensure all existing functionality works correctly after migration with comprehensive testing, this can lead to unit test optimization
- Documentation: Update developer documentation with new setup instructions and migration notes

#### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in the corresponding programming language (JavaScript and Angular for the main application)
- Previous contributions to open-source projects are highly desirable, demonstrating your commitment and collaborative skills

##### Mentors

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

> 🛑 Please be aware that the OWASP Juice Shop project will **not** consider or even review any proposals
> which fail to include an AI Tool Disclosure statement. We recommend you use the following templated that
> we derived from the one enforced on Pull Requests to OWASP Juice Shop:
>
> ```
> ### AI Tool Disclosure
>
> - [ ] My GSoC proposal does not include any AI-generated content
> - [ ] My GSoC proposal includes AI-generated content, as disclosed below:
>   - AI Tools: `[e.g. GitHub CoPilot, ChatGPT, JetBrains Junie etc.]`
>   - LLMs and versions: `[e.g. GPT-4.1, Claude Haiku 4.5, Gemini 2.5 Pro etc.]`
>   - Prompts: `[Summarize the key prompts or instructions given to the AI tools]`

#### 🔹 **OpenCRE Scraper & Indexer (Project OIE) - Module Projects**

The OpenCRE Scraper & Indexer is an autonomous ETL pipeline that ingests OWASP security knowledge from various sources, filters noise, and links content to the OpenCRE knowledge graph. This project consists of four independent modules, each suitable for a GSoC project.

**Important Requirements:**
- **Contributor Eligibility**: Applicants must have **at least 3 merged pull requests** to the OpenCRE repository before GSoC selection. This demonstrates familiarity with the codebase, contribution workflow, and project standards.
- **Code of Conduct**: All contributors must read and agree to follow the [OpenCRE Code of Conduct](https://github.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Violations will result in immediate project termination.
- **Pre-Code Experiments**: Each module requires completion of specific pre-code experiments before implementation begins. These experiments validate the approach and ensure technical feasibility.

For detailed architecture and requirements, see the [RFC: The OpenCRE Scraper & Indexer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OWASP/OpenCRE/1539e0a209b7891c2363b4aa9be407cad87fe319/docs/designs/owasp-pane-of-glass.md).

### [OWTF](https://owasp.org/www-project-owtf/)
OWTF attempts to solve the “penetration testers are never given enough time to test properly” problem, or in other words, OWTF = Test/Exploit ASAP, with this in mind, as of right now, the priorities are:

* To improve security testing efficiency (i.e. test more in less time)
* To improve security testing coverage (i.e. test more)
* Gradually integrate the best tools
* Unite the best tools and make them work together with the security tester
* Remove or Reduce the need to babysit security tools during security assessments
* Be a respository of PoC resource links to assist exploitation of vulnerabilities in order to illustrate risk to businesses.
* Help penetration testers save time on report writing

![Difficulty: Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange) OWTF Modernization

OWTF has evolved over time, but parts of the codebase are outdated, have technical debt, and may not be optimized for newer Python versions or best practices. This project aims to modernize the OWTF codebase, ensuring long-term maintainability, security, and efficiency.
Key Objectives
1. Fix Long-Standing Bugs & Improve Stability
    * Audit and resolve GitHub issues related to stability, crashes, and performance bottlenecks.
    * Enhance logging and error handling for better debugging.
    * Improve unit tests and CI/CD pipelines to catch regressions early.
2. Optimize Plugin Execution & Dependency Management
    * Upgrade outdated third-party security tools used in plugins.
    * Reduce dependency bloat by removing redundant libraries.
    * Use async execution where applicable for better performance.

###### Expected Outcomes
✔️ OWTF will be cleaner, faster, and easier to maintain.<br/>
✔️ The project will be future-proofed with up-to-date dependencies.<br/>
✔️ Stability and performance will be significantly improved.<br/>

![Difficulty: Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange) MiTM proxy upgrade

OWTF's proxy was written almost 10 years ago based on the Tornado Web Framework. It is in rough shape and needs a lot of improvement on the transaction recording, storing, and modification side. We want to make it as good as [MiTM proxy](https://mitmproxy.org/).


###### Expected Outcomes
✔️ Modern mitm proxy that allows modificaiton of requests and responses on the fly<br/>
✔️ Better integration with the framework to record a variety of requests and responses.<br/>
✔️ Stability and performance.<br/>
