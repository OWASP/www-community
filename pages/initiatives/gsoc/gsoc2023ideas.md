##### Explanation of Ideas
You can chose to work on one or a combination of ideas depending on the difficulty!
* Smart Contract - create an Ethereum smart contract to issue a token when a bug is found
* Flutter - 
	- Add designs for a dark theme in the Figma file, then implement a generic theme manager for future themes.
	- Start with app internationalization and localization (l10n).
	- ***Design and build the company side part of the app.***
	- ***Allow anonymous reporting*** for both logged-in and logged-out users, logged-in users should get an option to select whether to report a bug anonymously.
	- ***Close most of the current issues on the app repo.***
	- ***Bring the app to MVP level for both Android & iOS.*** 
* Django - Website integration of new design
* Private issue reporting - allow companies to switch on private issue reporting.
* Payments for issues reported - allow companies or individuals to pay big hunters
* Allow for the detection of banned apps in different countries. How would the internet look like if I was in country x.
* Allow for customers to track their online presence and help take down links where they did not approve their personal info on.
* Browser plug-in to check bug reports - scan each site visited against a database to see if any bugs were found - we have a plug-in for chrome, let’s update it.

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Score Board UI/UX

![Possible for "Medium" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-possible-yellow)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Hard](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-hard-red)

Juice Shop's existing Score Board has been rewritten from scratch once
when the project moved from AngularJS/Bootstrap to Angular/Material.
Since then, new features, filters and information has been added to it
over the years. It has grown to a point where it can be confusing for
beginners. It also became pretty slow to render over time.

After a big facelift project for all the other UI screens, the Score
Board now is the one screen left to require some special attention. As
it is the heart and soul of the Juice Shop, any redesign or usability
improvements must be thoroughly tested and strive for the best possible
user experience.

###### Companion Guide Tech Stack

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)

The official companion guide eBook ["Pwning OWASP Juice Shop"](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop) is today written in Markdown
and compiled with the GitBook legacy CLI into HTML (for [online reading](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop)) as well as EPUB/PDF (for the [free eBook on LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/juice-shop/)). As GitBook CLI is no longer maintained, it is only a question of time when the current build and publishing pipeline will
start failing from outdated tooling in general and specifically unsupported old versions of Node.js etc. The CI/CD pipeline for publishing
is currently running [on AppVeyor](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/bkimminich/pwning-juice-shop) whereas all other Juice Shop components are built with GitHub Actions.

With well over 12,000 readers on LeanPub alone, the eBook is definitely a cornerstone of Juice Shop's success, so it should receive a long-overdue
renewal of its technology stack. This includes a modern and future-proof authoring format (that still supports both online-reading and eBook export) as well
as moving the CI/CD pipeline over to GitHub.

###### Add Web3 specific hacking and coding challenges

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Possible for "Large" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-possible-yellow)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)

The Juice Shop currently focuses primarily on Web2 challenges and it would be good to expose some web3 challenges natively as well as third-party integrations.
The only concern we have is that playing around with the challenges should not impact the availability of the entire application. We are also open to having our own
in-memory blockchain if that is needed. This is currently an open-ended and a flexible project idea that can be discussed and planned!
Oh! Did I not mention we also have [our own NFTs](https://opensea.io/collection/juice-shop)?!

Find and discuss more about the project idea here at [juice-shop#1946](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/issues/1946)

###### Advanced Cheat Detection

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)

The [current Cheat Detection](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/appendix/cheat-detection.html) in Juice Shop is mostly based on expected timespans between solving two challenges.
It takes challenge difficulty and availability of in-app hints into consideration, as well as possible correlations or dependencies between challenges. It leaves a lot of possible
data sources out of its calculation, though. For example: Does the user always hit the solution on their first try, or do they explore the vulnerable functionality beforehand? Are the
HTTP requests showing signs of hacking tool usage? Are the solution steps _exactly_ reproduced from available official or even third party guides or videos?

Could maybe even techniques from banking fraud detection or actual game development be applied in the Juice Shop context?

### [OWASP secureCodeBox](https://www.securecodebox.io)

secureCodeBox is a kubernetes based, modularized toolchain for continuous security scans of your software project.
The secureCodeBox comes with many different scanners officially integrated (from Amass to Zap) and integration 
with vulnerability management backends like DefectDojo.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "securecodebox" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Rewrite DefectDojo Hook in Go(lang)

![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-yellow)

The current implementation of our [DefectDojo hook](https://github.com/secureCodeBox/secureCodeBox/tree/main/hooks/persistence-defectdojo) is written in Java.
As the remainder of the project is written in Go & JavaScript the code does not fit into the remainder of the project and suffers from typical Java problems 
like a comparatively large memory footprint and slow boot times.

The goals of the project are:

- moving the implementation to a modern Go implementation
- extracting the DefectDojo api calls to reusable golang library
- expanding end-to-end testability of the hook with a real DefectDojo instance in the CI pipeline

###### Add a secureCodeBox CLI (scbctl)

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2023 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-yellow)

The primary interface to interact with the secureCodeBox is through it's Custom Resources (CRs) in the Kubernetes API.
Writing the resource (e.g. [Scans](https://www.securecodebox.io/docs/scanners/amass#examplecom)) is generally not hard but can be cumbersome as the require the creation of a new file / multi line string in the command line.

To make these interactions easier to use and more fun, a custom (but optional) secureCodeBox CLI should help by automatically connecting to the Kubernetes API.

- create a new command line client which connects to the Kubernetes API and interacts with the CRs of the secureCodeBox
- write tests & including integration / e2e test and the CI pipeline (GitHub Actions)

#### CRS Transformations review

##### Summary

Systematic review of transformations, develop a guideline how to transform which parameters and in which order, implement the necessary changes

##### Description

This is one for the nerds, or for somebody who is not afraid to dig into the hairy details of language encodings and their implementation. The ModSecurity SecLang rule language that CRS uses comes with a few dozen of transformation that can help to simplify payloads that make it easier to detect attacks. Think of removing white space or perform base64 decoding. CRS uses this, but we have to admit in an not overly systematic way. So what we would need is somebody who looks at the various options, looks at frequent attacks and tells us which transformations / decodings should be used and in which situation, so we can follow this guideline in a systematic way.

##### Expected Outcomes

- A written guideline on how to transform which parameters
  - include the corresponding attacks if needed
  - and the precise order for all combinations based on the attack
- After discussion and approval, implement the necessary changes in the CRS

##### Skills required/preferred

- Good writing skills
- Basic knowledge about text conversion functions and Web encodings

##### Mentors

The CRS team will assign a mentor to contributors. In the meantime, the following two CRS project leaders will be your contacts:

* [Christian Folini](mailto:christian.folini@owasp.org)

##### SecLanguage platforms performance analysis

##### Summary

Systematic performance analysis on various SecLanguage platforms: Costs of operators, transformations and variables (depending on size of payload / varname+value and number of variables)

##### Description

This is a research project aiming to do a written report about the performance of the essential part of the SecRule language on various implementations, namely ModSecurity 2, libModSecurity 3, Coraza. The ModSecurity Handbook does not really go into enough detail of the performance impact of those constructs that CRS uses as its work horses. So we kind of depend on a gut feeling and a proper base and guideline would be very beneficial.

Without exaggerating too much, you need to keep in mind that CRS is running on millions of servers, some of them with hundreds of millions of requests per day (or more). If you now imagine that we could save some CPU cycles when we optimize the rules, then there is a big, big potential to good. Also to the planet in resource consumption.

##### Expected Outcomes

- Define a framework for testing performance for SecLanguage platforms
- Implement the framework so it can be used for testing 
- Write documentation on usage and techniques used to measure performance for the various constructs

##### Skills required/preferred

- Good writing skills
- Performance testing knowledge
- Basic programming language skills to implement the proposed framework

##### Mentors

The CRS team will assign a mentor to contributors. In the meantime, the following two CRS project leaders will be your contacts:

#### WAF Performance Testing Framework

##### Summary

Create a performance testing framework i. e. something like regression tests but for performance, so we can see impact on performance of every pull request.

##### Description

A frequent problem when developing new rules is their performance impact. Experience shows you do not really know the performance of a rule until you have tried it out. If you want to test it against a variety of payloads it's quite a lot of manual work and since we do not have a documented test procedure, it's all a bit random.

So the idea is to design a facility (typically a docker container) that is being configured with a rule and then used to test this rule with a variety of payloads and returns a standard report about the performance of the rule. Bonus points if multiple engines are covered (ModSecurity 2, libModSecurity 3, Coraza, ...)

##### Expected Outcomes

- Define a framework for testing performance for a generic WAF
- Implement the framework in a way that can be run in a pipeline for testing changes on configuratios/rules
- Write documentation on usage and techniques used to measure performance

##### Skills required/preferred

- Good writing skills
- Some performance testing knowledge would be useful
- Basic programming language skills to implement the proposed framework

##### New plugin for &lt;enter-your-cool-idea&gt;

##### Summary

Write new plugins to prevent attacks.

##### Description

We have recently added plugin functionality to CRS. The [Plugin Registry](https://github.com/coreruleset/plugin-registry) has a decent overview of existing plugins and this [blog post](https://coreruleset.org/20220209/introducing-the-fake-bot-plugin/) does a good job describing a very cool plugin for inspiration.

Think about writing another cool plugin to complement the repository.

##### Expected Outcomes

- Expose your need for a new plugin that complements existing work in the CRS
- Create the plugin and document it

##### Skills required/preferred

- Good writing skills
- Knowledge about the problem your are trying to solve with this plugin ;)
