## List of Project Ideas

### [OWASP ZAP](https://zaproxy.org/)

ZAP is the world’s most widely used web scanner. Previous GSoC contributors have added key features and are all listed in the [ZAP Student Hall of Fame](https://www.zaproxy.org/student-hall-of-fame/).

To get started with ZAP contributions see the [ZAP Contributing Guide](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/). We expect GSoC contributors who apply to work on ZAP to have had at least one code PR merged into one of the ZAP repos.

##### Import PCAP/PCAPNG Files
