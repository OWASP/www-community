## List of Project Ideas

### [OWASP ZAP](https://zaproxy.org/)

ZAP is the world’s most widely used web scanner. Previous GSoC contributors have added key features and are all listed in the [ZAP Student Hall of Fame](https://www.zaproxy.org/student-hall-of-fame/).

To get started with ZAP contributions see the [ZAP Contributing Guide](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/contribute/). We expect GSoC contributors who apply to work on ZAP to have had at least one code PR merged into one of the ZAP repos.

##### Explanation of Ideas
* Crypto - create a proof of stake coin called BUG
* Flutter - ideas to improve the app? Launch it on the App Store.
* Django - Website integration of new design
* Private issue reporting - allow companies to switch on private issue reporting.
* Payments for issues reported - allow companies or individuals to pay big hunters
* Browser plug-in to check bug reports - scan each site visited against a database to see if any bugs were found - we have a plug-in for chrome, let’s update it.
* Allow for the detection of banned apps in different countries. How would the internet look like if I was in country x.
* Allow for customers to track their online presence and help take down links where they did not approve their personal info on.
