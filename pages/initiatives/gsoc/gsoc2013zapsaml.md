# GSoC2013 - OWASP ZAP SAML Support

**Student** : Pulasthi Mahawithana

**Mentors** : Prasad Shenoy, Kevin Wall

## Introduction

The OWASP Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) is an easy to use integrated penetration testing tool for finding vulnerabilities in web applications. It is open-source under Apache License 2.0 and widely used by the computer security community.

SAML is an XML-based federated single sign-on (FSSO) protocol that uses security tokens containing assertions to pass information about a principal between a SAML authority (an identity provider), and a SAML consumer (a service provider). It enables web-based authentication and authorization scenarios including cross-domain single sign-on (SSO).

The Objective of this project is to develop a component for ZAP that will detect and fuzz various elements and attributes of a SAML Assertion.

## Project Goals, Scope and Deliverables, Implementation Plan

Please refer the [GSoC proposal](http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/proposal/review/google/gsoc2013/pulasthi7/19001) for the project idea.

## Project Code, Documentation

Development will be done in an [external code repository](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension) hosted at GitHub.

### Pre-Releases

- [0.1-alpha](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension/releases/tag/0.1a) Jul 29, 2013
- [0.2-alpha](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension/releases/tag/0.2a) Aug 12, 2013
- [1.0-alpha](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension/releases/tag/v1.0-alpha) Sep 20, 2013

## Project Progress

### Community bonding period (before 17th June)

Agreed to have video conference twice a week on Monday and Thursday to discuss the project progress and any issues that may occur.

- Clarification of project idea
- Read the SAML specs to get familiar with SAML standards and usages
- Identifying the use cases that need to be implemented
- Setting up the development environment.

### Week 1 (17th June - 23rd June)

#### Week's progress

- Finalizing the use cases
- Setting up the Third party applications to generate SAML requests/responses
- Intercepting the SAML requests/responses from ZAP and get familiar with the parameters
- Studying on ZAP core and extensions to start the coding

#### Plans for next week

- Intercept the requests and responses and log them to console/file

### Week 2 (24th June - 30th June)

#### Week's progress

- Created a project at GitHub for the development of the [extension](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension)
- Created a passive scanner to intercept and log SAML requests/responses in their raw values
- Wrote a component that can decode the SAMLRequest/ SAMLResponse parameters in a HTTP request
- Updated the passive scanner to log the decoded SAML messages to the console
- Studied on the ZAP's extension API

#### Plans for next week

- Design the UI for the extension
- Provide ability to view SAML messages in a GUI in readable XML format

### Week 3 (1st July - 7th July)

#### Week's progress

- Created an UI for resending Requests
- Added a hook to show the Extension Resender UI
- Added the ability to show the parameters and decoded SAML request in the resender UI

#### Plans for next week

- Implement Resend ability to the resender
- Parse and show the SAML parameters one by one and provide the ability to change parameters independently (Easier way than changing the whole message)

### Week 4 (8th July - 14th July)

#### Week's progress

- Worked on implementing the resender
- Designed mock UI for the active mode request editor

#### Plans for next week

- Finish the passive request resender
- Start the implementation of active request editor/resender.

### Week 5 (15th July - 21st July)

#### Week's progress

- Study on OpenSAML libraries
- Added the ability to view attribute name and value pairs for some frequently occurring attributes of SAML Auth requests
- Faced with a issue on packaging external libraries

#### Plans for next week

- Solve the issue with packaging the libraries
- Implement sending functionality for changed request
- Provide the ability to dynamically update attribute values and SAML message when either one changes
- Implement the ability to parse different SAML message types

### Week 6 (22nd July - 28th July)

#### Week's progress

- Got the issue with packaging the libraries fixed.
- Reset the development environment which was reverted to solve the packaging issue
- Added sending functionality for changed SAML message and retrieve the response
- Added the ability to update the SAML message/ Attributes dynamically on change of either.
- Added the ability to parse, view and edit SAML Response type messages
- Added a pre-release version (0.1-alpha) with the current progress. Source and binary are available at [temporary GitHub repository](https://github.com/pulasthi7/zap-saml-extension/releases/tag/0.1a)

#### Plans for next week

- Implement automatic attribute changing and resending
- Implement UI to set the automatic attribute changer settings

### Week 7 (29nd July - 04th August)

#### Week's progress

- Implemented the UIs for automatic attribute changer settings

#### Plans for next week

- Implement automatic attribute changing and resending
- Implement passive SAML request scanner to edit the requests
- Add the ability to save/load the configurations

### Week 8 (05th August - 11th August)

#### Week's progress

- Implemented predefined automatic attribute changing and sending to endpoint
- Implemented the passive scanner to intercept the SAML messages to edit them
- Added ability to save/load configurations to the files for later user

#### Plans for next week

- Bug fixes for the passive scanner component
- Prepare presentation for AppSec EU

### Week 9 (12th August - 18th August)

#### Week's progress

- Prepared presentation for AppSec EU
- Some bug fixing for passive scanner component

#### Plans for next week

- Start working on the XSW attack implementation
- Add support to change relay state parameter

### Week 10 (19th August - 25th August)

#### Week's progress

- Research on XSW attacks
- Testing the SPs against signature exclutions

#### Plans for next week

- Implement and integrate XSW attack ability to extension
- Add support to change relay state parameter
- Start on testing the extension

### Week 11 (26th August - 01st September)

#### Week's progress

- Changed the extension to use JAXP and XPath to change the attribute values (Removing OpenSAML dependency)
- Combined the extension configurations to save to/ load from a single xml file.
- Introduced type validation to attributes when changing their values. (i.e. String, Integer, TimeStamp...)
- Started on unit and integration testing

#### Plans for next week

- Write unit tests and integration tests
- Update XSW attack ability to new architecture
- Add support to change relay state parameter

### Week 12 (02nd September - 08th September)

#### Week's progress

- Started on writing tests for extension
- Added XSW attack ablility

#### Plans for next week

- Improve test coverage
- Add support to change relay state
