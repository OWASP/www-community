## List of Project Ideas

### [Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](https://owasp.org/www-project-bug-logging-tool/)

OWASP BLT is a **bug-hunting & logging platform** that enables users to hunt for vulnerabilities, participate in bug bounties, and contribute to open-source security. Organizations can leverage BLT to manage vulnerability reports, track security issues, and engage with ethical hackers.  

BLT is a large-scale project with a growing ecosystem, offering **full-stack development, security automation, AI-powered analysis, and blockchain-based incentives**. This yearâ€™s GSoC projects focus on **UI/UX improvements, API development, automation, and gamification** to enhance the platform's usability and impact.  

> Preference will be given to students who have at least **5 merged PRs** before GSoC selection.

##### Medium Feature Pack for the DSOMM Main Application (JS)
![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
This pack includes tasks that are crucial for enhancing the user experience and functionality of the DSOMM main application. Contributors will address existing issues and add new features:
- Implement a **State or Tag for "Not yet assessed"**, addressing [Issue #241](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/241) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Enhance the **Excel download feature in "Mapping"** by adding assessment information, as discussed in [Issue #244](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/244#issuecomment-1811127472) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Refine the handling of **subcategories** to streamline the organization and presentation of maturity model elements, making the tool more intuitive. See [Issue #194](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/194) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Introduce the **Adding of Diagrams** feature to enhance the visualization of DevSecOps processes and maturity levels, as outlined in [Issue #183](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/183) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

##### Large Feature Pack for the metric Analyzer and Collector (Java)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)
This pack challenges students to develop the entire workflow from data collection to visualization for DSOMM metrics, including the implementation of a Kafka queue. Projects include:
- Design and implement a **collector for OWASP DefectDojo**, fetching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) and Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) via the [defectdjo-client](https://github.com/SDA-SE/defectdojo-client) which fetches MTTR/MTTP) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Develop a **collector for Jira**, to retrieve information about security tasks. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Create a **collector for Jenkins and Kubernetes**, aimed at measuring deployment frequency by team, a key metric in DevOps performance. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Engineer a **collector for GitHub and Bitbucket**, to calculate MTTP by tracking pull request opening and merge dates. In addition, check that _branch protection_ is enabled and a .gitignore exists in the root file system. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Engineer a **collector for gitleaks**, fetching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) and Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

Please take a look at the [architecture digram of DSOMM metricCA](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/metricCA). The whole way from the collector to grafana needs to be implemented. Please note that a queue Kafka and Prometheus is currently not implemented and needs to be implemented in the collector and in the metricAnalyzer.

For Backstage, Jira and Confluence a defined format and tags might be used to identify the corresponding team and type of document (e.g. threat modeling/pentest).

#### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in the corresponding programming language (JavaScript for the main application, Java for the metric analyzer and collector)
- Previous contributions to open-source projects are highly desirable, demonstrating your commitment and collaborative skills

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### MultiJuicer as a CTF Platform

![Not recommended for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-not%20recommended-red)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-hard-red)

MultiJuicer saw some enhancements of its Team Score Board last year. It now is not that far away from being a full-fledged CTF platform of its own. This project should focus on the remaining features needed to make MultiJuicer a fully functional CTF platform. This should include making the Team Score Board visually attractive, flavorfully unique and more competition-oriented. The existing Solution Webhook integration already marks solved challenges automatically, but other information like team cheat score, progress over time etc. are not tracked or displayed today. The MultiJuicer CTF should offer the same features as the Juice Shop CTF tool in order to configure the availability of hints. This should include a way to allow teams to pay for hints with some of their collected points. To avoid issues with bigger teams hacking on the same instance of Juice Shop, a team grouping mechanism could be considered as well. The progress on the CTF Score Board could then be aggregated on group level for different teams/instances.

###### Test suite harmonization

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)

Juice Shop had a full replacement of its end-to-end test suite - from Protractor to Cypress - in its GSoC 2022 project. Now it is time to take on the remainin test suites, especially the Integration/API tests currently running on Frisby.js. That library as not seen updates in 2+ years and it became more and more flaky over the years, causing occasional CI/CD failures and time-consuming retry-mechanisms to keep those in check. A new foundation for these tests is needed. In scope is also to look at the frontend and backend unit test suites, and find a way to reduce the number of test frameworks being used in order to achieve higher consistency and less complexity for maintenance of the project. This project should include the test suites in the Juice Shop CTF tool as well. Proposals that also have the augmentation of MultiJuicer with end-to-end tests in scope, are specially welcome.  

###### Juice Shop side-project rennovation

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)

The Juice Shop CTF Tool is currently implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It should be migrated to TypeScript for consistency of maintenance with the main project. Furthermore, the code linting should be adapted to the main Juice Shop ESLint standards. Test coverage and relevance should be reviewed and strengthened where necessary.

Similarly, the following other sub-projects should be rennovated and brought onto an identical tech stack: Juicy Statistics, Juicy Coupon Bot, Juicy Chat Bot, and Juicy Coupon Lambda.
