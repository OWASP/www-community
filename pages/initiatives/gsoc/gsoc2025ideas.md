## List of Project Ideas

### [Bug Logging Tool (BLT)](https://owasp.org/www-project-bug-logging-tool/)

OWASP BLT is a _bug-hunting & logging_ tool which allows users and companies to hunt for bugs, claim bug bounties and also to start bug-hunting sprees/contests respectively. It is preferred if the potential GSoC contributors get at least 5 PRs merged for the project. Preference will be given to students
who get the most work done, and this is usually by submitting the most PRs.

##### 2025 GSOC Ideas / Projects

1. **Redesign with Dark Mode** – A UI/UX overhaul using Tailwind, potentially Figma files, and HTML implementation to create a modern, accessible design with dark mode as the default.  

2. **BLT Light Front-End in React** – A lightweight React-based front-end designed to stay under 100MB, ensuring high performance and accessibility with an optimized component structure.  

3. **Organization Dashboard – Better Integration Between Website & Orgs** – Enhancing the organization dashboard to allow management of vulnerability reports, bug reports, contributor metrics, and various content types for better oversight.  

4. **Full API with Security Tests and Definitions to Support New Light Front-End (Migrate to Django Ninja?)** – Developing a secure, well-documented API with automated security tests to support the new front-end, potentially migrating to Django Ninja for improved performance and maintainability.  

5. **Gamification and Integration with Ordinals & Solana (Combined with GitHub-Integrated Contribution Tracking)** – A GitHub-integrated platform that tracks open-source contributions and rewards users with Bitcoin Ordinals and Solana-based incentives, introducing gamification elements like badges and leaderboards.  

6. **Bid on Issues (Using Bitcoin Cash, No BLT Financial Transactions)** – A decentralized bidding system where developers can bid on GitHub issues using Bitcoin Cash, with a verification system ensuring direct fund transfers between project owners and contributors without BLT handling transactions.  

7. **Build the Flagship** – A comprehensive effort to gather information, refine platform features, ensure compliance, and collaborate with the board, executive director, and project committee to establish BLT's flagship product.  

8. **Slack Bot Enhancements – Integrate More Features** – Expanding the Slack bot's functionality to integrate more features from the website, enabling better automation, notifications, and user interactions.  

9. **AI-Driven Open-Source Grant & Funding Tracker** – A platform that helps OWASP projects and other open-source initiatives discover, apply for, and manage grant and funding opportunities using AI-powered recommendations.  

10. **AI-Powered Open-Source Code Review & Quality Assurance Bot** – A GitHub-integrated AI assistant that analyzes pull requests, detects security vulnerabilities and inefficiencies, and provides actionable code improvement suggestions.

Join us in enhancing the DSOMM, a pivotal tool designed to improve the security and operational efficiency of software development processes. We are looking for passionate students to contribute to two major areas: our main application development in JavaScript and our metric analyzer and collector in Java. Whether you are looking to tackle medium-sized challenges or are ready to embark on a larger project, we have exciting opportunities for you.

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "dsomm" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Medium Feature Pack for the DSOMM Main Application (JS)
![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
This pack includes tasks that are crucial for enhancing the user experience and functionality of the DSOMM main application. Contributors will address existing issues and add new features:
- Implement a **State or Tag for "Not yet assessed"**, addressing [Issue #241](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/241) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Enhance the **Excel download feature in "Mapping"** by adding assessment information, as discussed in [Issue #244](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/244#issuecomment-1811127472) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Refine the handling of **subcategories** to streamline the organization and presentation of maturity model elements, making the tool more intuitive. See [Issue #194](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/194) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Introduce the **Adding of Diagrams** feature to enhance the visualization of DevSecOps processes and maturity levels, as outlined in [Issue #183](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/DevSecOps-MaturityModel/issues/183) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

##### Large Feature Pack for the metric Analyzer and Collector (Java)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)
This pack challenges students to develop the entire workflow from data collection to visualization for DSOMM metrics, including the implementation of a Kafka queue. Projects include:
- Design and implement a **collector for OWASP DefectDojo**, fetching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) and Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) via the [defectdjo-client](https://github.com/SDA-SE/defectdojo-client) which fetches MTTR/MTTP) ![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)
- Develop a **collector for Jira**, to retrieve information about security tasks. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Create a **collector for Jenkins and Kubernetes**, aimed at measuring deployment frequency by team, a key metric in DevOps performance. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Engineer a **collector for GitHub and Bitbucket**, to calculate MTTP by tracking pull request opening and merge dates. In addition, check that _branch protection_ is enabled and a .gitignore exists in the root file system. ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- Engineer a **collector for gitleaks**, fetching Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) and Mean Time to Patch (MTTP) ![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)
- **Your Idea:** Proposals that innovate or enhance the metric collection and analysis process are highly encouraged.

Please take a look at the [architecture digram of DSOMM metricCA](https://github.com/devsecopsmaturitymodel/metricCA). The whole way from the collector to grafana needs to be implemented. Please note that a queue Kafka and Prometheus is currently not implemented and needs to be implemented in the collector and in the metricAnalyzer.

For Backstage, Jira and Confluence a defined format and tags might be used to identify the corresponding team and type of document (e.g. threat modeling/pentest).

#### Prerequisites
- Proficiency in the corresponding programming language (JavaScript for the main application, Java for the metric analyzer and collector)
- Previous contributions to open-source projects are highly desirable, demonstrating your commitment and collaborative skills

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### MultiJuicer as a CTF Platform

![Not recommended for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-not%20recommended-red)
![Preferred for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-preferred-green)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-hard-red)

MultiJuicer saw some enhancements of its Team Score Board last year. It now is not that far away from being a full-fledged CTF platform of its own. This project should focus on the remaining features needed to make MultiJuicer a fully functional CTF platform. This should include making the Team Score Board visually attractive, flavorfully unique and more competition-oriented. The existing Solution Webhook integration already marks solved challenges automatically, but other information like team cheat score, progress over time etc. are not tracked or displayed today. The MultiJuicer CTF should offer the same features as the Juice Shop CTF tool in order to configure the availability of hints. This should include a way to allow teams to pay for hints with some of their collected points. To avoid issues with bigger teams hacking on the same instance of Juice Shop, a team grouping mechanism could be considered as well. The progress on the CTF Score Board could then be aggregated on group level for different teams/instances.

###### Test suite harmonization

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Medium](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-medium-orange)

Juice Shop had a full replacement of its end-to-end test suite - from Protractor to Cypress - in its GSoC 2022 project. Now it is time to take on the remainin test suites, especially the Integration/API tests currently running on Frisby.js. That library as not seen updates in 2+ years and it became more and more flaky over the years, causing occasional CI/CD failures and time-consuming retry-mechanisms to keep those in check. A new foundation for these tests is needed. In scope is also to look at the frontend and backend unit test suites, and find a way to reduce the number of test frameworks being used in order to achieve higher consistency and less complexity for maintenance of the project. This project should include the test suites in the Juice Shop CTF tool as well. Proposals that also have the augmentation of MultiJuicer with end-to-end tests in scope, are specially welcome.  

###### Juice Shop side-project rennovation

![Preferred for "Medium" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/medium%20size%20(~175h)-preferred-green)
![Not recommended for "Large" GSoC 2025 project](https://img.shields.io/badge/large%20size%20(~350h)-not%20recommended-red)

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/difficulty-easy-green)

The Juice Shop CTF Tool is currently implemented in vanilla JavaScript. It should be migrated to TypeScript for consistency of maintenance with the main project. Furthermore, the code linting should be adapted to the main Juice Shop ESLint standards. Test coverage and relevance should be reviewed and strengthened where necessary.

Similarly, the following other sub-projects should be rennovated and brought onto an identical tech stack: Juicy Statistics, Juicy Coupon Bot, Juicy Chat Bot, and Juicy Coupon Lambda.
