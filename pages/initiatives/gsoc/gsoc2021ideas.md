## List of Project Ideas

### [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Score Board

Juice Shop's existing Score Board has been rewritten from scratch once
when the project moved from AngularJS/Bootstrap to Angular/Material.
Since then, new features, filters and information has been added to it
over the years. It has grown to a point where it can be confusing for
beginners. It also became pretty slow to render over time.

After a big facelift project for all the other UI screens, the Score
Board now is the one screen left to require some special attention. As
it is the heart and soul of the Juice Shop, any redesign or usability
improvements must be thoroughly tested and strive for the best possible
user experience.

###### Coding Challenges

Juice Shop's upcoming [Vulnerable Code Snippets](http://bkimminich.github.io/juice-shop/#/5/7) serve as a foundation for an ambitious new
training aspect: Coding challenges. In their current implementation the
snippets come with a spoiler area for the actually vulnerable line(s) of code. Instead, they could
offer a list of lines from which the user must select the actually vulnerable one, whereas the others simply
act as ruses. This enhancement alone would obviously not fill the time available in a GSoC project.

It could be extended by a code fixing aspect, where the user must select the right fix
from a list of choices. Or even more ambitious, a code editor could be offered where the vulnerable line(s) must
actually be fixed, and the code is then executed or statically checked in the background, to see if the vulnerability is gone.

Both parts - finding and fixing - could yield points on the Score Board, where the "hacking" and "coding" challenges
could be tracked separately. It should be configurable, if the user must first solve the hacking challenge to be offered
the corresponding coding challenge or if they are available all the time. It is even thinkable to provide CTF flags for
fixed code, so that hacking and fixing could be both offered as CTF challenges - effectively doubling the number of challenges
in a Juice Shop-powered CTF event.

###### Your own idea

You have an awesome idea to improve OWASP Juice Shop that is not on this
list? Great, please submit it!

##### Expected Results

* A new feature or improvement of an existing one that makes OWASP Juice
  Shop even better
* Your code follows our existing styleguides and passes all existing
  quality gates regarding code smells, test coverage etc.
* Code that you write comes with automated tests that fit into
  [our available test suites](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part3/contribution.html#testing).

### [OWASP OWTF](https://github.com/owtf/owtf)
Offensive Web Testing Framework (OWTF) is a project focused on penetration testing efficiency and alignment of security tests to security standards like the OWASP Testing Guide (v3 and v4), the OWASP Top 10, PTES and NIST. Most of the ideas below focus on rewrite of some major 
components of OWTF to make it more modular. OWTF is moving to a fresh codebase with a fully Docker testing and deployment environment.

#### OWASP OWTF - Passive Online scanner improvements

##### Brief Explanation

OWTF allows many passive tests, such as those using third party websites like Google, Bing, etc. searches, as well as handy "Search for vulnerability" search boxes (i.e. Fingerprinting plugin). This feature involves the creation of a "script" that produces an interactive OWTF report with the intention of hosting it in the github.io site. The idea here is to have a passive, JavaScript-only interactive report available on the owtf.github.io site, so that people can try OWTF "without installing anything", simply visiting a URL.

This would be a normal OWTF interactive report where the user can:
* Enter a target
* Try passive plugins (only the parts that use no tools)
* Play with boilerplate templates from the OWTF interactive report
An old version of the passive online scanner is hosted [here](https://owtf.github.io/online-passive-scanner).

##### LEGAL CLARIFICATION (Just in case!): 
The passive online scanner, simply makes OWTF passive testing through third party websites more accessible to anybody, however it is the user that must 
1. click the link manually + 
2. do something bad with that afterwards + 
3. doing 1 + 2 WITHOUT permission :). 
Therefore this passive online scanner does not do anything illegal 
[More information about why this is not illegal here](http://www.slideshare.net/abrahamaranguren/legal-and-efficient-web-app-testing-without-permission) 
(recommended reading!)

For background on OWASP OWTF please see: [OWASP OWTF](https://owasp.org/www-project-owtf/)

##### Expected results:
* IMPORTANT: [PEP-8 compliant code](http://legacy.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)/ES6 JavaScript code in all modified code and surrounding areas.
* High performance
* Reliability
* Ease of use
* Test cases
* Good documentation

##### Knowledge Prerequisite:

A good knowledge of JavaScript and writing ES6 compliant React/TypeScript is needed. Previous exposure to security concepts and penetration testing is not required but recommended and some lack of this can be compensated with pre-GSoC involvement and will to learn.

### [Security Knowledge Framework (SKF)](https://owasp.org/www-project-security-knowledge-framework/)

#### Idea One: Extending the SKF Labs with code fixing functionality

We have more then 70 SKF Labs for developers to practice the skills in security in terms of identifying and testing vulnerabilities.
Now the idea is to also create the capability to make code changes in all of the Labs using a browser editor and displaying log output.

With this editor in the labs we can now also use it to train and get experience in applying the secure design patterns and mitigating the vulnerabilities in the labs.

##### Idea One: Expected Results

* Implement a HTML Editor functionality to allow all the files within the Docker image to be updated
* Implement a application log window to see stacktraces or errors
* The component that is running next to the Lab application needs to be build so it can be used for all type of Languages we use in the Labs, for example Python, Java, Ruby, Nodejs


#### Idea Two: Your own idea

Let us know if you have a strong other idea! :)


#### Knowledge Prerequisites

* Docker
* HTML
* Angular9
* Javascript
* Design / styling
* Python
* Kubernetes

##### Getting Started
Have a look at the SKF Labs and inspect the Docker files, source code of the Labs and get an idea how we build them.
These are then all used in the OWASP-SKF project where people can launch the Labs from there in a Kubernetes Cluster.
