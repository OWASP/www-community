- Check our
  [github organization](https://github.com/OWASP).
- Contact one of the project mentors below.

## List of Project Ideas

###  [OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp-juice.shop)

OWASP Juice Shop is probably the most modern and sophisticated insecure
web application! It can be used in security trainings, awareness demos,
CTFs and as a guinea pig for security tools! Juice Shop encompasses
vulnerabilities from the entire OWASP Top Ten along with many other
security flaws found in real-world applications!

To receive early feedback please:
- put your proposal on Google Docs and submit it to the OWASP
  Organization on Google's GSoC page in "Draft Shared" mode.
- Please pick "juice shop" as Proposal Tag to make them easier to find
  for us. Thank you!

##### Explanation of Ideas

###### Score Board

Juice Shop's existing Score Board has been rewritten from scratch once
when the project moved from AngularJS/Bootstrap to Angular/Material.
Since then, new features, filters and information has been added to it
over the years. It has grown to a point where it can be confusing for
beginners. It also became pretty slow to render over time.

After a big facelift project for all the other UI screens, the Score
Board now is the one screen left to require some special attention. As
it is the heart and soul of the Juice Shop, any redesign or usability
improvements must be thoroughly tested and strive for the best possible
user experience.

###### Your own idea

You have an awesome idea to improve OWASP Juice Shop that is not on this
list? Great, please submit it!

##### Expected Results

* A new feature or improvement of an existing one that makes OWASP Juice
  Shop even better
* Your code follows our existing styleguides and passes all existing
  quality gates regarding code smells, test coverage etc.
* Code that you write comes with automated tests that fit into
  [our available test suites](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part3/contribution.html#testing).

##### Getting started

* Make sure your JavaScript/TypeScript is sufficient to work on the
  Juice Shop codebase. Check our
  [Codebase 101](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part3/codebase.html)
  here. Students with some experience with (or willingness to learn)
  Angular and NodeJS/Express are usually prefered.
* Read our
  [Contribution Guidelines](https://pwning.owasp-juice.shop/part3/contribution.html)
  very carefully. Best make some small contributions before GSoC, so we
  can see how you work and help you dive into the code even better.
* Get in touch with
  [Bjoern Kimminich](mailto:bjoern.kimminich@owasp.org) to discuss any
  of the listed or your own idea for GSoC!
