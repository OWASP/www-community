## Overview

In a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) attack, the attacker can abuse
functionality on the server to read or update internal resources. The
attacker can supply or modify a URL which the code running on the
server will read or submit data to, and by carefully selecting the URLs,
the attacker may be able to read server configuration such as AWS
metadata, connect to internal services like http enabled databases or
perform post requests towards internal services which are not intended
to be exposed.

## Description

The target application may have functionality for importing data from a
URL, publishing data to a URL or otherwise reading data from a URL that
can be tampered with. The attacker modifies the calls to this
functionality by supplying a completely different URL or by manipulating
how URLs are built (path traversal etc.).

When the manipulated request goes to the server, the server-side code
picks up the manipulated URL and tries to read data to the manipulated
URL. By selecting target URLs the attacker may be able to read data from
services that are not directly exposed on the internet:

  - Cloud server meta-data - Cloud services such as AWS provide a REST
    interface on <http://169.254.169.254/> where important configuration
    and sometimes even authentication keys can be extracted
  - Database HTTP interfaces - NoSQL database such as MongoDB provide
    REST interfaces on HTTP ports. If the database is expected to only
    be available to internally, authentication may be disabled and the
    attacker can extract data
  - Internal REST interfaces
  - Files - The attacker may be able to read files using <file://> URIs

The attacker may also use this functionality to import untrusted data
into code that expects to only read data from trusted sources, and as
such circumvent input validation.
