## Description

Spyware is a program that captures statistical information from a user's
computer and sends it over internet without user acceptance. This
information is usually obtained from cookies and the web browserâ€™s
history. Spyware can also install other software, display
advertisements, or redirect the web browser activity. Spyware differs
from a virus, worm, and adware in various ways. Spyware does not
self-replicate and distribute itself like viruses and worms, and does
not necessarily display advertisements like adware. The common
characteristics between spyware and viruses, worms, and adware are:

1.  exploitation of the infected computer for commercial purposes
2.  the display, in some cases, of advertisements

## Risk Factors

High

Some Spyware is very dificult to remove because it can hide in Browser
Cookies and Offline HTML Content in Temporary files.
