## Description

A Trojan Horse is a program that uses malicious code masqueraded as a
trusted application. The malicious code can be injected on benign
applications, masqueraded in e-mail links, or sometimes hidden in
JavaScript pages to make furtive attacks against vulnerable internet
Browsers.

Other details can be found in [Man-in-the-browser
attack](Man-in-the-browser_attack "wikilink").

### The 7 Main Types of Trojan Horse

1.  **Remote Access Trojan (RAT):** Designed to provide the attacker
    full control of the infected machine. Trojan horse usually
    masqueraded as a utility.
2.  **Data Sending Trojan:** Trojan horse that uses keylogger technology
    to capture sensitive data like passwords, credit card and banking
    information, and IM messages, and sends them back to the attacker.
3.  **Destructive Trojan:** Trojan horse designed to destroy data stored
    on the victimâ€™s computer.
4.  **Proxy Trojan:** Trojan horse that uses the victim's computer as a
    proxy server, providing the attacker an opportunity to execute
    illicit acts from the infected computer, like banking fraud, and
    even malicious attacks over the internet.
5.  **FTP Trojan:** This type of Trojan horse uses the port 21 to enable
    the attackers to connect to the victim's computer using File
    Transfer Protocol.
6.  **Security software disabler Trojan:** This Trojan horse is designed
    to disable security software like firewall and antivirus, enabling
    the attacker to use many invasion techniques to invade the victim's
    computer, and even to infect more than the computer.
7.  **Denial-of-Service attack Trojan:** Trojan horse designed to give
    the attacker opportunity to realize Denial-of-Service attacks from
    victim's computer.

### Symptoms

Some common symptoms:

  - Wallpaper and other background settings auto-changing
  - Mouse pointer disappears
  - Programs auto-loading and unloading
  - Strange window warnings, messages and question boxes, and options
    being displayed constantly
  - e-mail client auto sending messages to all on the user's contacts
    list
  - Windows auto closing
  - System auto rebooting
  - Internet account information changing
  - High internet bandwidth being used without user action
  - Computer's high resources consumption (computer slows down)
  - Ctrl + Alt + Del stops working

## Risk Factors

High: A Trojan horse can break through all security polices in a
network, because an attacker can get access to a WorkStation with stored
network credentials. With these credentials, an attacker can compromise
the whole network.

## Examples

An iframe pointing to a javascript which downloads malware:
