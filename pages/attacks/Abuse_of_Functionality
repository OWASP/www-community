## Description

An Abuse of Functionality attack is the misuse of inherent application
features, sometimes referred to as business logic vulnerabilities, or insufficient anti-automation. 
The misuse may adversely affect the application itself, the applications' users,
and the application's owners.

Abuse of Functionality can include Denial of Service (DoS), but DoS is often only side-effect
of the intended attack, not the primary aim.
