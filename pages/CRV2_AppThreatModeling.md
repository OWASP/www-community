### Introduction

Threat modeling is an approach for analyzing the security of an
application. It is a structured approach that enables you to identify,
quantify, and address the security risks associated with an application.
Threat modeling is not an approach to reviewing code, but it does
complement the security code review process. The inclusion of threat
modeling in the SDLC can help to ensure that applications are being
developed with security built-in from the very beginning. This, combined
with the documentation produced as part of the threat modeling process,
can give the reviewer a greater understanding of the system. This allows
the reviewer to see where the entry points to the application are and
the associated threats with each entry point. The concept of threat
modeling is not new but there has been a clear mindset change in recent
years. Modern threat modeling looks at a system from a potential
attacker's perspective, as opposed to a defender's viewpoint. Microsoft
have been strong advocates of the process over the past number of years.
They have made threat modeling a core component of their SDLC, which
they claim to be one of the reasons for the increased security of their
products in recent years.

When source code analysis is performed outside the SDLC, such as on
existing applications, the results of the threat modeling help in
reducing the complexity of the source code analysis by promoting an
in-depth first approach vs. breadth first approach. Instead of reviewing
all source code with equal focus, you can prioritize the security code
review of components whose threat modeling has ranked with high risk
threats.

The threat modeling process can be decomposed into 3 high level steps:

**Step 1:** Decompose the Application. The first step in the threat
modeling process is concerned with gaining an understanding of the
application and how it interacts with external entities. This involves
creating use-cases to understand how the application is used,
identifying entry points to see where a potential attacker could
interact with the application, identifying assets i.e. items/areas that
the attacker would be interested in, and identifying trust levels which
represent the access rights that the application will grant to external
entities. This information is documented in the Threat Model document
and it is also used to produce data flow diagrams (DFDs) for the
application. The DFDs show the different paths through the system,
highlighting the privilege boundaries.

**Step 2:** Determine and rank threats. Critical to the identification
of threats is using a threat categorization methodology. A threat
categorization such as STRIDE can be used, or the Application Security
Frame (ASF) that defines threat categories such as Auditing & Logging,
Authentication, Authorization, Configuration Management, Data Protection
in Storage and Transit, Data Validation, Exception Management. The goal
of the threat categorization is to help identify threats both from the
attacker (STRIDE) and the defensive perspective (ASF). DFDs produced in
step 1 help to identify the potential threat targets from the attacker's
perspective, such as data sources, processes, data flows, and
interactions with users. These threats can be identified further as the
roots for threat trees; there is one tree for each threat goal. From the
defensive perspective, ASF categorization helps to identify the threats
as weaknesses of security controls for such threats. Common threat-lists
with examples can help in the identification of such threats. Use and
abuse cases can illustrate how existing protective measures could be
bypassed, or where a lack of such protection exists. The determination
of the security risk for each threat can be determined using a
value-based risk model such as DREAD or a less subjective qualitative
risk model based upon general risk factors (e.g. likelihood and impact).

**Step 3:** Determine countermeasures and mitigation. A lack of
protection against a threat might indicate a vulnerability whose risk
exposure could be mitigated with the implementation of a countermeasure.
Such countermeasures can be identified using threat-countermeasure
mapping lists. Once a risk ranking is assigned to the threats, it is
possible to sort threats from the highest to the lowest risk, and
prioritize the mitigation effort, such as by responding to such threats
by applying the identified countermeasures. The risk mitigation strategy
might involve evaluating these threats from the business impact that
they pose and reducing the risk. Other options might include taking the
risk, assuming the business impact is acceptable because of compensating
controls, informing the user of the threat, removing the risk posed by
the threat completely, or the least preferable option, that is, to do
nothing.

Each of the above steps are documented as they are carried out. The
resulting document is the threat model for the application. This guide
will use an example to help explain the concepts behind threat modeling.
The same example will be used throughout each of the 3 steps as a
learning aid. The example that will be used is a college library
website. At the end of the guide we will have produced the threat model
for the college library website. Each of the steps in the threat
modeling process are described in detail below.

## Decompose the Application

The goal of this step is to gain an understanding of the application and
how it interacts with external entities. This goal is achieved by
information gathering and documentation. The information gathering
process is carried out using a clearly defined structure, which ensures
the correct information is collected. This structure also defines how
the information should be documented to produce the Threat Model.

## Threat Model Information

The first item in the threat model is the information relating to the
threat model. This must include the the following:

1.  **Application Name** - The name of the application.
2.  **Application Version** - The version of the application.
3.  **Description** - A high level description of the application.
4.  **Document Owner** - The owner of the threat modeling document.
5.  **Participants** - The participants involved in the threat modeling
    process for this application.
6.  **Reviewer** - The reviewer(s) of the threat model.

The college library website is the first implementation of a website to
provide librarians and library patrons (students and college staff) with
online services. As this is the first implementation of the website, the
functionality will be limited. There will be three users of the
application:
1\. Students
2\. Staff
3\. Librarians
Staff and students will be able to log in and search for books, and
staff members can request books. Librarians will be able to log in, add
books, add users, and search for books.

## External Dependencies

External dependencies are items external to the code of the application
that may pose a threat to the application. These items are typically
still within the control of the organization, but possibly not within
the control of the development team. The first area to look at when
investigating external dependencies is how the application will be
deployed in a production environment, and what are the requirements
surrounding this. This involves looking at how the application is or is
not intended to be run. For example if the application is expected to be
run on a server that has been hardened to the organization's hardening
standard and it is expected to sit behind a firewall, then this
information should be documented in the external dependencies section.
External dependencies should be documented as follows:

1.  **ID** - A unique ID assigned to the external dependency.
2.  **Description** - A textual description of the external dependency.

## Entry Points

Entry points define the interfaces through which potential attackers can
interact with the application or supply it with data. In order for a
potential attacker to attack an application, entry points must exist.
Entry points in an application can be layered, for example each web page
in a web application may contain multiple entry points. Entry points
should be documented as follows:

1.  **ID** - A unique ID assigned to the entry point. This will be used
    to cross reference the entry point with any threats or
    vulnerabilities that are identified. In the case of layer entry
    points, a major.minor notation should be used.
2.  **Name** - A descriptive name identifying the entry point and its
    purpose.
3.  **Description** - A textual description detailing the interaction or
    processing that occurs at the entry point.
4.  **Trust Levels** - The level of access required at the entry point
    is documented here. These will be cross referenced with the trusts
    levels defined later in the document.

## Assets

The system must have something that the attacker is interested in; these
items/areas of interest are defined as assets. Assets are essentially
threat targets, i.e. they are the reason threats will exist. Assets can
be both physical assets and abstract assets. For example, an asset of an
application might be a list of clients and their personal information;
this is a physical asset. An abstract asset might be the reputation of
an organsation. Assets are documented in the threat model as follows:

1.  **ID** - A unique ID is assigned to identify each asset. This will
    be used to cross reference the asset with any threats or
    vulnerabilities that are identified.
2.  **Name** - A descriptive name that clearly identifies the asset.
3.  **Description** - A textual description of what the asset is and why
    it needs to be protected.
4.  **Trust Levels** - The level of access required to access the entry
    point is documented here. These will be cross referenced with the
    trust levels defined in the next step.

## Trust Levels

Trust levels represent the access rights that the application will grant
to external entities. The trust levels are cross referenced with the
entry points and assets. This allows us to define the access rights or
privileges required at each entry point, and those required to interact
with each asset. Trust levels are documented in the threat model as
follows:

1.  **ID** - A unique number is assigned to each trust level. This is
    used to cross reference the trust level with the entry points and
    assets.
2.  **Name** - A descriptive name that allows you to identify the
    external entities that have been granted this trust level.
3.  **Description** - A textual description of the trust level detailing
    the external entity who has been granted the trust level.

## Data Flow Diagrams

All of the information collected allows us to accurately model the
application through the use of Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs). The DFDs will
allow us to gain a better understanding of the application by providing
a visual representation of how the application processes data. The focus
of the DFDs is on how data moves through the application and what
happens to the data as it moves. DFDs are hierarchical in structure, so
they can be used to decompose the application into subsystems and
lower-level subsystems. The high level DFD will allow us to clarify the
scope of the application being modeled. The lower level iterations will
allow us to focus on the specific processes involved when processing
specific data. There are a number of symbols that are used in DFDs for
threat modeling. These are described below:

**External Entity**
The external entity shape is used to represent any entity outside the
application that interacts with the application via an entry point.

![Image:DFD_external_entity.gif](DFD_external_entity.gif
"Image:DFD_external_entity.gif")

**Process**
The process shape represents a task that handles data within the
application. The task may process the data or perform an action based on
the data.

![Image:DFD_process.gif](DFD_process.gif "Image:DFD_process.gif")

**Multiple Process**
The multiple process shape is used to present a collection of
subprocesses. The multiple process can be broken down into its
subprocesses in another DFD.

![Image:DFD_multiple_process.gif](DFD_multiple_process.gif
"Image:DFD_multiple_process.gif")

**Data Store**
The data store shape is used to represent locations where data is
stored. Data stores do not modify the data, they only store data.

![Image:DFD_data_store.gif](DFD_data_store.gif
"Image:DFD_data_store.gif")


**Data Flow**
The data flow shape represents data movement within the application. The
direction of the data movement is represented by the arrow.

![Image:DFD_data_flow.gif](DFD_data_flow.gif
"Image:DFD_data_flow.gif")

**Privilege Boundary**
The privilege boundary shape is used to represent the change of
privilege levels as the data flows through the application.

"Image:DFD_privilge_boundary.gif")

## Determine and Rank Threats

### Threat Categorization

The first step in the determination of threats is adopting a threat
categorization. A threat categorization provides a set of threat
categories with corresponding examples so that threats can be
systematically identified in the application in a structured and
repeatable manner.

#### STRIDE

A threat categorization such as STRIDE is useful in the identification
of threats by classifying attacker goals such as:

  - Spoofing
  - Tampering
  - Repudiation
  - Information Disclosure
  - Denial of Service
  - Elevation of Privilege.

A threat list of generic threats organized in these categories with
examples and the affected security controls is provided in the following
table:

## Threat Analysis

The prerequisite in the analysis of threats is the understanding of the
generic definition of risk that is the probability that a threat agent
will exploit a vulnerability to cause an impact to the application. From
the perspective of risk management, threat modeling is the systematic
and strategic approach for identifying and enumerating threats to an
application environment with the objective of minimizing risk and the
associated impacts.

Threat analysis as such is the identification of the threats to the
application, and involves the analysis of each aspect of the application
functionality and architecture and design to identify and classify
potential weaknesses that could lead to an exploit.

In the first threat modeling step, we have modeled the system showing
data flows, trust boundaries, process components, and entry and exit
points. An example of such modeling is shown in the Example: Data Flow
Diagram for the College Library Website.

Data flows show how data flows logically through the end to end, and
allows the identification of affected components through critical points
(i.e. data entering or leaving the system, storage of data) and the flow
of control through these components. Trust boundaries show any location
where the level of trust changes. Process components show where data is
processed, such as web servers, application servers, and database
servers. Entry points show where data enters the system (i.e. input
fields, methods) and exit points are where it leaves the system (i.e.
dynamic output, methods), respectively. Entry and exit points define a
trust boundary.

Threat lists based on the STRIDE model are useful in the identification
of threats with regards to the attacker goals. For example, if the
threat scenario is attacking the login, would the attacker brute force
the password to break the authentication? If the threat scenario is to
try to elevate privileges to gain another user’s privileges, would the
attacker try to perform forceful browsing?

It is vital that all possible attack vectors should be evaluated from
the attacker’s point of view. For this reason, it is also important to
consider entry and exit points, since they could also allow the
realization of certain kinds of threats. For example, the login page
allows sending authentication credentials, and the input data accepted
by an entry point has to validate for potential malicious input to
exploit vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross site scripting, and
buffer overflows. Additionally, the data flow passing through that point
has to be used to determine the threats to the entry points to the next
components along the flow. If the following components can be regarded
critical (e.g. the hold sensitive data), that entry point can be
regarded more critical as well. In an end to end data flow, for example,
the input data (i.e. username and password) from a login page, passed on
without validation, could be exploited for a SQL injection attack to
manipulate a query for breaking the authentication or to modify a table
in the database.

Exit points might serve as attack points to the client (e.g. XSS
vulnerabilities) as well for the realization of information disclosure
vulnerabilities. For example, in the case of exit points from components
handling confidential data (e.g. data access components), exit points
lacking security controls to protect the confidentiality and integrity
can lead to disclosure of such confidential information to an
unauthorized user.

In many cases threats enabled by exit points are related to the threats
of the corresponding entry point. In the login example, error messages
returned to the user via the exit point might allow for entry point
attacks, such as account harvesting (e.g. username not found), or SQL
injection (e.g. SQL exception errors).

From the defensive perspective, the identification of threats driven by
security control categorization such as ASF, allows a threat analyst to
focus on specific issues related to weaknesses (e.g. vulnerabilities) in
security controls. Typically the process of threat identification
involves going through iterative cycles where initially all the possible
threats in the threat list that apply to each component are evaluated.

At the next iteration, threats are further analyzed by exploring the
attack paths, the root causes (e.g. vulnerabilities, depicted as orange
blocks) for the threat to be exploited, and the necessary mitigation
controls (e.g. countermeasures, depicted as green blocks). A threat tree
as shown in figure 2 is useful to perform such threat analysis

![Figure 2: Threat Graph](Threat_Graph.gif "Figure 2: Threat Graph")

Once common threats, vulnerabilities, and attacks are assessed, a more
focused threat analysis should take in consideration use and abuse
cases. By thoroughly analyzing the use scenarios, weaknesses can be
identified that could lead to the realization of a threat. Abuse cases
should be identified as part of the security requirement engineering
activity. These abuse cases can illustrate how existing protective
measures could be bypassed, or where a lack of such protection exists. A
use and misuse case graph for authentication is shown in figure below:

![UseAndMisuseCase.jpg](UseAndMisuseCase.jpg "UseAndMisuseCase.jpg")

Finally, it is possible to bring all of this together by determining the
types of threat to each component of the decomposed system. This can be
done by using a threat categorization such as STRIDE or ASF, the use of
threat trees to determine how the threat can be exposed by a
vulnerability, and use and misuse cases to further validate the lack of
a countermeasure to mitigate the threat.

To apply STRIDE to the data flow diagram items the following table can
be used:

TABLE

## Ranking of Threats

Threats can be ranked from the perspective of risk factors. By
determining the risk factor posed by the various identified threats, it
is possible to create a prioritized list of threats to support a risk
mitigation strategy, such as deciding on which threats have to be
mitigated first. Different risk factors can be used to determine which
threats can be ranked as High, Medium, or Low risk. In general, threat
risk models use different factors to model risks such as those shown in
figure below:

![Figure 3: Risk Model Factors](Riskfactors.JPG
"Figure 3: Risk Model Factors")

## DREAD

In the Microsoft DREAD threat-risk ranking model, the technical risk
factors for impact are Damage and Affected Users, while the ease of
exploitation factors are Reproducibility, Exploitability and
Discoverability. This risk factorization allows the assignment of values
to the different influencing factors of a threat. To determine the
ranking of a threat, the threat analyst has to answer basic questions
for each factor of risk, for example:

  - For Damage: How big would the damage be if the attack succeeded?
  - For Reproducibility: How easy is it to reproduce an attack to work?
  - For Exploitability: How much time, effort, and expertise is needed
    to exploit the threat?
  - For Affected Users: If a threat were exploited, what percentage of
    users would be affected?
  - For Discoverability: How easy is it for an attacker to discover this
    threat?

By referring to the college library website it is possible to document
sample threats releated to the use cases such as:

**Threat: Malicious user views confidential information of students,
faculty members and librarians.**

1.  **Damage potential:** Threat to reputation as well as financial and
    legal liability:8
2.  **Reproducibility:** Fully reproducible:10
3.  **Exploitability:** Require to be on the same subnet or have
    compromised a router:7
4.  **Affected users:** Affects all users:10
5.  **Discoverability:** Can be found out easily:10

Overall DREAD score: (8+10+7+10+10) / 5 = 9

In this case having 9 on a 10 point scale is certainly an high risk
threat

## Generic Risk Model

A more generic risk model takes into consideration the Likelihood (e.g.
probability of an attack) and the Impact (e.g. damage potential):

**Risk = Likelihood x Impact**

The likelihood or probability is defined by the ease of exploitation,
which mainly depends on the type of threat and the system
characteristics, and by the possibility to realize a threat, which is
determined by the existence of an appropriate countermeasure.

The following is a set of considerations for determining ease of
exploitation:

1.  Can an attacker exploit this remotely?
2.  Does the attacker need to be authenticated?
3.  Can the exploit be automated?

The impact mainly depends on the damage potential and the extent of the
impact, such as the number of components that are affected by a threat.

Examples to determine the damage potential are:

1.  Can an attacker completely take over and manipulate the system?
2.  Can an attacker gain administration access to the system?
3.  Can an attacker crash the system?
4.  Can the attacker obtain access to sensitive information such as
    secrets, PII

Examples to determine the number of components that are affected by a
threat:

1.  How many data sources and systems can be impacted?
2.  How “deep” into the infrastructure can the threat agent go?

These examples help in the calculation of the overall risk values by
assigning qualitative values such as High, Medium and Low to Likelihood
and Impact factors. In this case, using qualitative values, rather than
numeric ones like in the case of the DREAD model, help avoid the ranking
becoming overly subjective.

## Countermeasure Identification

The purpose of the countermeasure identification is to determine if
there is some kind of protective measure (e.g. security control, policy
measures) in place that can prevent each threat previosly identified via
threat analysis from being realized. Vulnerabilities are then those
threats that have no countermeasures. Since each of these threats has
been categorized either with STRIDE or ASF, it is possible to find
appropriate countermeasures in the application within the given
category.

Provided below is a brief and limited checklist which is by no means an
exhaustive list for identifying countermeasures for specific threats.

Example of countermeasures for ASF threat types are included in the
following table:

Once threats and corresponding countermeasures are identified it is
possible to derive a threat profile with the following criteria:

1.  **Non mitigated threats:** Threats which have no countermeasures and
    represent vulnerabilities that can be fully exploited and cause an
    impact
2.  **Partially mitigated threats:** Threats partially mitigated by one
    or more countermeasures which represent vulnerabilities that can
    only partially be exploited and cause a limited impact
3.  **Fully mitigated threats:** These threats have appropriate
    countermeasures in place and do not expose vulnerability and cause
    impact
