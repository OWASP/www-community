[Source code analysis](Static_Code_Analysis) tools, also
referred to as Static Application Security Testing (SAST) Tools, are
designed to analyze source code and/or compiled versions of code to help
find security flaws.

Some tools are starting to move into the IDE. For the types of problems
that can be detected during the software development phase itself, this
is a powerful phase within the development life cycle to employ such
tools, as it provides immediate feedback to the developer on issues they
might be introducing into the code during code development itself. This
immediate feedback is very useful, especially when compared to finding
vulnerabilities much later in the development cycle.

## Strengths and Weaknesses

### Strengths

  - Scales well -- can be run on lots of software, and can be run
    repeatedly (as with nightly builds or continuous integration)
  - Useful for things that such tools can automatically find with high
    confidence, such as buffer overflows, SQL Injection Flaws, and so
    forth
  - Output is good for developers -- highlights the precise source
    files, line numbers, and even subsections of lines that are affected

### Weaknesses

  - Many types of security vulnerabilities are difficult to find
    automatically, such as authentication problems, access control
    issues, insecure use of cryptography, etc. The current state of the
    art only allows such tools to automatically find a relatively small
    percentage of application security flaws. However, tools of this
    type are getting better.
  - High numbers of false positives.
  - Frequently can't find configuration issues, since they are not
    represented in the code.
  - Difficult to 'prove' that an identified security issue is an actual
    vulnerability.
  - Many of these tools have difficulty analyzing code that can't be
    compiled. Analysts frequently can't compile code because they don't
    have the right libraries, all the compilation instructions, all the
    code, etc.

## Important Selection Criteria

  - Requirement: Must support your programming language, but not usually
    a key factor once it does.
  - Types of vulnerabilities it can detect (out of the [OWASP Top
    Ten](OWASP_Top_Ten "wikilink")?) (plus more?)
  - How accurate is it? False Positive/False Negative rates?
      - Does the tool have an OWASP [Benchmark](Benchmark "wikilink")
        score?
  - Does it understand the libraries/frameworks you use?
  - Does it require a fully buildable set of source?
  - Can it run against binaries instead of source?
  - Can it be integrated into the developer's IDE?
  - How hard is it to setup/use?
  - Can it be run continuously and automatically?
  - License cost for the tool. (Some are sold per user, per org, per
    app, per line of code analyzed. Consulting licenses are frequently
    different than end user licenses.)
