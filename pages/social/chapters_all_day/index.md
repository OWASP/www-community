Leaders from OWASP Chapters throughout the world invite you to join us for 24 hours of non-stop AppSec!

We'll kick off the festivities with Welcoming Remarks and a Keynote presentation at 12:00 noon (UTC) on Saturday, 6 June. Then, each hour, the (virtual) floor will be handed over to a leader from another OWASP Chapter, who will introduce speakers from their chapter/region.

At 12:00 noon (UTC) on Sunday, 7 June, we'll wrap things up with a brief recap and closing remarks.

The entire event will be live-streamed on the **[OWASP Chapters All Day](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJNkJT42qFOBdnD8pCpelrw/videos?view=2&flow=grid&live_view=502){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}** YouTube Channel. Each presentation segment (usually one hour in length) is hosted by a different Chapter Leader and will be streamed separately. Live viewers will need to select a new stream to view each host change, while those viewing the recordings later will find 25 videos, listed by hour and host chapter (e.g., "**OWASP Chapters All Day - Hour 01 - Opening Session**" or "**OWASP Chapters All Day - Hour 13 - New Zealand**").
