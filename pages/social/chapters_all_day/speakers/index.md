### Is Your Phone Your Enemy or Your Friend?
*Silvia Arias Becker and Oscar Orellana Artigas*

#### Abstract

In this presentation, we will provide information related to the risks you are exposed to through the apps you download to your mobile. We will review the OWASP Mobile Top 10 and use them in real APK analysis. If you are using your mobile more than ever for social media and even for work, this is the presentation you need in your life now!

Telephone devices have become our biggest repository of personal and private information, containing our banking and social network data. They allow us to read news and choose the type of information we want to read, creating a clear profile of our tastes and preferences.  They also store the personal data of our family and people with whom we interact frequently.

All of the above is great, if it is under our control and we can privately isolate that personal information. So what happens if our phone's operating system decides to publish that data or share it so other entities can access and know our tastes and everything that we thought was private?

### Small, But Fierce (But Still Small)
*Erica Anderson*

#### Abstract

Most of us volunteer or work closely with small groups. These are the local community groups, the side gigs, the small family businesses, the weekend projects. These groups are small but mighty. They use data, technology, and systems to provide us a service to make our communities better places. We need them to exist; and we also need them to be secure. This talk is going to focus on the few, free steps that any small group can take to level up their security, the stories and reasoning behind them, and give you some manna for dispelling the security misconceptions that come with being small.

#### Speaker Biography

**Erica Anderson (*@sputina*):** Her twitter bio says "info sec, cat, and ketchup enthusiast" which summarizes her quite nicely. Erica is a space cadet (and Principal Security Consultant) for SafeStack and leads their Wellington presence. She also causes general mayhem with Kiwicon, Kawaiicon, and (previously) BSides Wellington. 

### Let Me Secure That for You
*Kirk Jackson, Chapter Leader, OWASP New Zealand*

#### Abstract

Is it possible to wrap security around an insecure website? Wouldn't it be great if security was something you could just add later?

This talk will introduce virtual patching, what types of security issues can be fixed, and dive a bit deeper into Content Security Policy.

#### Speaker Biography

Kirk worked as a web developer before switching to the defense team - setting up the security practice at Xero, working as a pen tester, and in defense roles at several companies.
