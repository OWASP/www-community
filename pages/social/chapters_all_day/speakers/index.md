### Talk 2 - A Practical Approach for Taking Down Avalanche Botnets Under Real-World Constraints
*Victor Le Pochat - PhD student web security at KU Leuven*

#### Abstract

In 2016, law enforcement conducted the largest takedown of a cybercrime operation so far, targeting the Avalanche botnet. 
They faced a challenge when blocking future registration of the C&C domains: some of these domains already existed, and this was not necessarily for malicious purposes.<br>
In our talk, we discuss our collaboration in developing an approach to improve detection of these false positives for the ongoing cleanup of Avalanche. We'll explain how we leveraged the synergy of a machine learning model and human analyst to reduce manual effort without compromising correctness.

### Is Your Phone Your Enemy or Your Friend?
*Silvia Arias Becker and Oscar Orellana Artigas*

#### Abstract

In this presentation, we will provide information related to the risks you are exposed to through the apps you download to your mobile. We will review the OWASP Mobile Top 10 and use them in real APK analysis. If you are using your mobile more than ever for social media and even for work, this is the presentation you need in your life now!

Telephone devices have become our biggest repository of personal and private information, containing our banking and social network data. They allow us to read news and choose the type of information we want to read, creating a clear profile of our tastes and preferences.  They also store the personal data of our family and people with whom we interact frequently.

All of the above is great, if it is under our control and we can privately isolate that personal information. So what happens if our phone's operating system decides to publish that data or share it so other entities can access and know our tastes and everything that we thought was private?

### Your Taxes Are Being Leaked
*Michael Wylie*

#### Abstract

80% of U.S. small business accounting data is entered and stored on one vendor's software. Major professional CPA firms around the world use this vendor's tax preparation software and trust that the security controls are doing their job. During a Penetration Test, I discovered, and responsibly disclosed to the vendor, a critical unauthenticated information leak vulnerability in the way the software transfers customer data between client and server. This vulnerability exposes all customers' names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, social security numbers, job, spouse information, and more. After further testing, it became clear that the problem was bigger than just one piece of software in one industry, as multiple CVEs were discovered during testing.

### Session Host: Walter Mart&iacute;n Villalba, *Chapter Leader*

### HTTP Security Headers
*Walter Mart&iacute;n Villalba - Chapter Leader, OWASP Santa Barbara*

#### Abstract

HTTP headers let web clients and servers exchange additional information (usually metadata) in HTTP messages. HTTP *security* headers define whether a set of security mechanisms should be enabled on the web client. They are a fundamental part of web security as they help protect against different types of attacks such as XSS, code injection, and session hijacking. In this talk, we'll discuss the most common security headers, how to configure them properly, and look at some real-world examples of misconfigurations that led to successful attacks.

### Content Security Policy: Going From Idea to Afterthought 
*Neil Matatall*

#### Abstract

Content security policy (CSP) is a browser feature that allows an application to tell a browser what is allowed to happen on a given page. It can be a very powerful tool when used correctly. But it's a tricky beast with a lot of complexity, esoteric details, gotchas, and is still not widely adopted by most of the Internet, by any measure.

Any random article on CSP will talk about its features and behaviors. Some talk about the "report-only" mode for testing out CSP and analyzing reports. But how do you go from no CSP to a solid CSP? A light overview of CSP with a focus on mitigating cross-site scripting will be followed by an explanation of strategies to create an effective and dynamic policy including code samples taken directly from the GitHub codebase.

#### Speaker Biography

### Vulnerable Dependencies: It's Not About Discovery
*Omer Levi Hevroni*

#### Abstract

We are all already familiar with the risk of vulnerable dependencies. We've all heard at least one talk about why it is an issue, and have likely seen at least one demo of hacking using a vulnerable dependency.

This talk is going to be different. Instead of focusing on tools, or rehashing the issue, this talk will focus on how to actually mitigate these vulnerable dependencies. There are many tools out there for finding them. But this is just the first step.

The real question is: How do we start remediating these vulnerabilities once we find them? How do we get developers and product managers to care about them and prioritize fixing them? Should we fix all of them? How can we automate this process?

Join me to hear about some of the pains I had over the last few years while trying to answer some of these questions. I'll share some of the things that worked for me, and hopefully may be applicable for you as well. This talk will be vendor-neutral as it will focus more on culture and processes - instead of specific tooling.

#### Speaker Biography

**Omer Levi Hevroni**: I have been coding since 4th grade, when my dad taught me BASIC and I got hooked. From that point, I learned to code in many programming languages (today my favorite is C#). Today I'm working at Snyk, and coding is a huge part of my day job.

My passion for AppSec started by accident when I was offered the role of security champion. The AppSec journey was (and still is) fascinating, and taught me a lot. OWASP helped me a lot during this journey; This is why I decided to become a paying member and am also leading the OWASP Glue Project.

My current job is DevSecOps - helping the entire team to produce more secure software. Besides my job, I'm also giving a lot of talks all over the world, and heavy OSS contributor - mainly to Kamus, a secret encryption solution for Kubernetes platform.

When not working, I'm enjoying the company of my two beloved kids.

### Use Cryptography; Don't Learn It
*Anastasiia Voitova*

#### Abstract

We'll talk about "boring crypto": why developers shouldn't spend time learning all the details of crypto-algorithms (or invent new ones). How to avoid typical crypto-mistakes when all you need is to protect data at rest or in motion. There are enough ready-to-use cryptographic libraries and tools for everyone.

This talk was first presented at OWASP Kyiv Winter 2017. Still relevant.

### Cybersecurity Economics
*Vlad Styran - Chapter Leader, OWASP Kyiv*

#### Abstract

This is a small recap of a Cybersecurity Economics 101 course I took on edEX. It was a huge surprise to me, a "seasoned" professional with more than 15 years of experience, to discover the economic concepts behind the security market. Security spending and investment are literally sunk costs. We spend money and the best Return on Investment that we could get is...nothing happens. In these circumstances, it is crucial to know how to correctly plan and control the amount of effort we put into security. Because whether we've overspent or underspend, we would hurt the business in either case.

#### Speaker Biography

## Hour 23 - Hosted by OWASP Cambridge (UK)

### Session Host: Adrian Winckles, *Chapter Leader*

### OWASP Application Security Curriculum Project
*Adrian Winckles - Project Leader*

#### Abstract

Part of OWASP's main purpose is to "Be the thriving global community that drives visibility and evolution in the safety and security of the world's software." A key part of that mission is to educate not just the current generation of developers or information security professionals, but also the next generation, particularly in the context of the acknowledged skills shortage in the security sector.

A common problem with many security education programmes (whether cyber or InfoSec) or even traditional computer science programmes is that they do not address application security adequately, if at all. In some regions, attempts have been made to address this deficit.

In the UK for example, (ISC)2 and the BCS are working on an initiative to embed security firmly within the Computer Science curriculum, with an emphasis on secure coding techniques. OWASP, through my involvement, also champions this initiative.

There is an opportunity for OWASP to pull together its wide-ranging expertise, projects, and dedicated volunteers to engage in these types of education programmes and initiatives by developing an educational strategy for undergraduate and postgraduate students. This could take the form of an open "Standard" curriculum template which can be adopted and adapted by diverse educational partners and organisations. Such a template would also give a useful starting point or reference document for when we engage with other professional bodies.

#### Speaker Biography

**Adrian Winckles** is Director for the Cyber Security, Networking & Big Data Research Group and Security Researcher at Anglia Ruskin University. He is OWASP Cambridge Chapter Leader, OWASP Europe Board Member and is involved in rebooting the Cambridge Cluster of the UK Cyber Security Forum.

#### Abstract

The OWASP SecureFlag Community Edition is an open-source training platform created for developers to learn and practice modern secure coding techniques through hands-on exercises.

Developers manually find, exploit and remediate the code of vulnerable applications running in disposable development environments accessed via a web browser. The platform offers 100% hands-on training, with no multiple-choice questions involved. The platform helps develop secure coding skills through real-world challenges to ensure knowledge acquired during the course can be confidently and continuously applied in the real world.

This short talk will focus on showing how SecureFlag can be used to tailor internal security learning paths for devs/devops, including the basics about the SDK and the Exercise Hub.
