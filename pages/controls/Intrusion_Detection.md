## Description

The line between Intrusion Detection and Intrusion Prevention Systems
(IDS and IPS respectively) has become increasingly blurred. However,
these two controls are distinguished primarily by how they respond to
detected attacks. While an Intrusion Detection System passively monitors
for attacks and provides notification services, an Intrusion Prevention
System actively stops the threat. For example, a Network Intrusion
Detection System (NIDS) will monitor network traffic and alert security
personnel upon discovery of an attack. A Network Intrusion Prevention
System (NIPS) functions more like a stateful firewall and will
automatically drop packets upon discovery of an attack.

There are two primary reasons why many organizations favor the use of
IDSs over IPSs. The first is that, in the event of a false positive
(normal activity mistakenly identified as an attack), an IPS will
actively stop the normal activity which is likely to negatively impact
business functions. An IDS, on the other hand, will only notify on the
false positive and will not impact business functions while the security
professional verifies the validity of the alert. The second reason is
that IPSs can become a serious bottleneck. While IPSs must be placed
in-line in order to actively stop attacks, and IDS may be placed on a
mirrored port, thus preventing a potential bottle neck.

Intrusion detection is an important countermeasure for most
applications, especially client-server applications like web
applications and web services. Many newer technologies are beginning to
include integrated services such as a single device that incorporates a
firewall, IDS, and limited IPS functionality.
[Logging](Logging "wikilink") is an important aspect of intrusion
detection, but is best viewed as a way to record intrusion-related
activity, not to determine what is an intrusion in the first place. The
vast majority of applications do not detect attacks, but instead try
their best to fulfill the attackers' requests.

Lack of intrusion detection allows an attacker to attempt attacks until
a successful one is identified. Intrusion detection allows the attack to
be identified long before a successful attack is likely. It is not very
difficult for a web application to identify some attack traffic. A
simple rule-of-thumb is that if the traffic could not have reasonably
been generated by a legitimate user of the application, it is almost
certainly an attack. Once alerted by the IDS and the attacks are
identified, then the security professional can respond appropriately.
Typically, this means logging off the user, invalidating their account,
potentially recording information for the authorities, or patching the
root cause vulnerability.

There are three types of requests that an application might receive:

  - Almost certainly an attack
  - Not sure whether it an attack or not
  - Almost certainly legitimate input

The question for application developers is how to deal with these three
categories. The safest rule is to assume that everything except
legitimate traffic is an attack. However, this will probably create a
lot of false alarms for users. So perhaps it is best to accept the
requests that you are not sure about and log some extra information so
that you can investigate it later. This is a policy decision that you
should make during the requirements phase of the lifecycle.

In terms of the accuracy of an IDS, there are four possible states for
each activity observed. A true positive state is when the IDS identifies
an activity as an attack and the activity is actually an attack. A true
positive is a successful identification of an attack. A true negative
state is similar. This is when the IDS identifies an activity as
acceptable behavior and the activity is actually acceptable. A true
negative is successfully ignoring acceptable behavior. Neither of these
states are harmful as the IDS is performing as expected. A **false
positive** state is when the IDS identifies an activity as an attack but
the activity is acceptable behavior. A false positive is a false alarm.
A **false negative** state is the most serious and dangerous state. This
is when the IDS identifies an activity as acceptable when the activity
is actually an attack. That is, a false negative is when the IDS fails
to catch an attack. This is the most dangerous state since the security
professional has no idea that an attack took place. False positives, on
the other hand, are an inconvenience at best and can cause significant
issues. However, with the right amount of overhead, false positives can
be successfully adjudicated; false negatives cannot.

There are different types of Intrusion Detection systems based on
different approaches. The two main divisions exist between signature
based IDSs and behavioral IDSs. There are multiple subcategories
depending on the specific implementation. Signature based IDSs, like
Snort, function like anti-virus software. They have known attack lists
against which they check new activity for attacks. If the new activity
matches a known attack signature, the system will generate an alert.
Behavioral based IDSs work differently. They learn, through a number of
methods (the most popular of which is statistical analysis), what
constitutes normal behavior. Once the system has a profile of normal
behavior, it aims to detect abnormal behavior, which generates alerts.
Currently, signature based systems are more common since they are more
reliable (less false negatives), provide less false positives, and allow
for easier false positive resolution. Behavioral based IDSs tend to be
less accurate (more false negatives), produce an extremely large number
of false positives, and false positives are more difficult to
adjudicate. That being said, it is possible for a behavioral IDS to
identify novel attacks like zero day exploits, given that the novel
attack varies from normal behavior. A signature based IDS cannot ever
identify novel attacks like zero day exploits since it identifies
attacks based on known attack signatures.

In addition, there are different types of Intrusion Detection systems
based on the goal of the system. While the market on the following types
of IDSs is become more and more fractured, the primary types by goal are
**Network based IDSs (NIDS)** and **Host based IDSs (HIDS)**. There are
some extensions of this dichotomy to include distributed IDSs and
comprehensive host based security systems. However, the main distinction
is the goal and placement of the IDS. A NIDS monitors network traffic,
usually on a mirrored port or in-line and can be placed in a variety of
locations on the network. NIDS work by inspecting network traffic and
can be signature based or behavioral based. HIDS monitors system logs,
application logs, and other activities on a host system such as a server
or user workstation. HIDS work primarily by monitory system logs and
behavior and can be signature based (include rule sets that enforce
tailored security policies) or behavioral based. Most organizations use
both types of IDSs. They use HIDSs to secure critical host systems and
NIDSs to secure their network(s).

Best practices for the placements of NIDS is a future topic.
