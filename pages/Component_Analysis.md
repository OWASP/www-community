Modern software is assembled using third-party and open source components, glued together in complex and unique ways, 
and integrated with original code to provide the desired functionality. Third-party (including commercially licensed,
proprietary, and "source available" software) along with open source components provide the necessary building blocks 
that allow organizations to deliver value, improve quality, reduce risk and time-to-market. The benefits of open source 
are many. However, by using open source components, organizations ultimately take responsibility for code they did not 
write. Strategic alliances between organizations and open source projects can lead to healthy open source usage and 
overall risk reduction.

Component Analysis is the process of identifying potential areas of risk from the use of third-party and open-source 
software and hardware components. Component Analysis is a function within an overall [Cyber Supply Chain Risk
Management](https://csrc.nist.gov/projects/supply-chain-risk-management) (C-SCRM) framework. A software-only subset of 
Component Analysis with limited scope is commonly referred to as Software Composition Analysis (SCA).

Any component that has the potential to adversely impact cyber supply-chain risk is a candidate for Component Analysis.

## Common Risk Factors

#### Component Inventory

Having an accurate inventory of all third-party and open source components is pivotal for risk identification. Without 
such knowledge, other factors of Component Analysis become impractical to determine with high confidence. Use of 
dependency management solutions and/or [Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM)](#software-bill-of-materials-sbom) can aid in
inventory creation.

#### Component Age

Components may have varying degrees of age acceptance criteria. Factors that impact acceptable age include the [type of
component](#component-type), the ecosystem the component is a part of (Maven, NPM, etc), and the purpose of the 
component. The age of a component may signify use of outdated technology and may have a higher probability of being 
passed over by security researchers.

#### Outdated Components

Newer versions of components may improve quality or performance. These improvements can be inherited by the applications 
that have a dependency on them. Components that are end-of-life (EOL) or end-of-support (EOS) also impact risk. Two 
common approaches to community supported open-source is:

  - Support the latest revision of the last (x) releases - (i.e. 4.3.6 and 4.2.9)
  - Support only the latest published version (i.e. 4.3.6 today and 4.4.0 tomorrow)

Depending on the risk appetite, it may be strategic to only use third-party and open source components that are supported.

With reference to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) terminology, API changes can be expected between major 
versions of a component, but are rare between minor versions and patches. Changes in a components API may result in 
longer remediation times if the components have not been continuously updated. Keeping components up-to-date can
reduce remediation time when a rapid response is warranted.

Outdated version identification may leverage ecosystem-specific repositories and is achievable through the use of 
dependency managers or [Package URL](#component-identification). Component analysis can identify outdated components as 
well as provide information about newer versions.

#### Known Vulnerabilities

Historically, known vulnerabilities referred to entries (CVEs) in the 
[National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) (NVD). The NVD describes (via [CPE](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe)) 
three types of components:

  - Applications (includes libraries and frameworks)
  - Operating Systems
  - Hardware

While the NVD may be the most recognizable source of vulnerability intelligence, it's not the only. There are multiple 
public and commercial sources of vulnerability intelligence. Having a *known* vulnerability doesn't require the 
vulnerability information be present in one of these sources. Simply being documented (i.e. social media post, defect 
tracker, commit log, release notes, etc) classifies the vulnerability as being *known*.

Component analysis will commonly identify known vulnerabilities from multiple sources of vulnerability intelligence.

#### Component Type

Frameworks and libraries have unique upgrade challenges and associated risk. Abstractions, coupling, and architectural 
design patterns may affect the risk of using a given component type. For example, logging libraries may be embedded 
throughout a large application, but replacing implementations can likely be automated. Likewise, replacing a web 
application framework for an alternative framework would likely be a high-risk endeavor leading to architectural changes, 
regressions, and code rewrites. Evaluating the type should be part of every Component Analysis strategy.

#### Component Function

Identifying and analyzing the purpose of each component may reveal the existence of components with duplicate or similar 
functionality. For example, it's unlikely an application would need multiple XML parsers or cryptographic providers. 
Potential risk can be reduced by minimizing the number of components for each function and by choosing the highest
quality components for each function. Evaluating component function should be part of every Component Analysis strategy.

#### Component Quantity

The number of third-party and open source components in a project should be evaluated. The operational and maintenance 
cost of using open source will increase with the adoption of every new component. The impact can be significantly higher 
with micro-module ecosystems when there are hundreds or thousands of applications in a given environment. In addition to 
increased operational and maintenance cost, a decrease in a development teams ability to maintain growing sets of 
components over time can be expected. This is especially true for teams with time-boxed constraints.

#### Repository Trust

Components in many software ecosystems are published and distributed to central repositories. Repositories have known 
threats. Some of the threats against public repositories include:

  - Typosquatting - naming a component in such as way as to take advantage of common misspelling
  - Organization/Group abuse - pretending to be a public person or entity and abusing the perceived trust
  - Malware through transfer - leveraging weak or absent code-signing requirements to spread malware through the 
    transfer of an open source project from one maintainer to another
  - Cross Build Injection (XBI) - Abusing dependency resolution schemes and weak infrastructure controls to inject 
    malicious components in place of safe ones

Public repositories that have code-signing and verification requirements have some level of trust, whereas public 
repositories without basic countermeasures do not. For no-trust or low-trust repositories, utilizing private 
repositories may be advantageous. Private repositories refer to repositories where access is limited, usually software 
that organizations install and control, or a commercially available service. *Golden repositories* containing vetted or 
whitelisted components are a common use-case for private repositories. Private repository services focusing on security 
may additionally provide anti-malware analysis and static source code analysis requirements prior to acceptance in the
repository. When leveraging private repositories, it is important to have traceability to the components' repository of 
origin.

#### Pedigree

A component's pedigree (sometimes referred to as 'provenance') refers to the traceability of all changes (i.e. commits), 
releases, modifications, packaging, and distribution across the entire supply chain. In physical supply chains this is 
referred to as the *chain of custody*. Obtaining a components pedigree may involve a mixture of automation across 
multiple systems and suppliers, along with legal and verifiable supporting documentation. Component pedigree includes 
all supporting documentation of lineage and the attributes which make a component unique.

#### License

Third-party and open-source software typically has one or more licenses assigned. The chosen license may or may not 
allow certain types of usage, contain distribution requirements or limitations, or require specific actions if the 
component is modified. Component Analysis can identify the license(s) for a given component and may optionally provide
guidance as to the nature of the license (i.e. copyright, copyleft, OSI approved, etc). Utilizing components with 
licenses which conflict with an organizations objectives or ability can create serious risk to the business.

#### Inherited Risk

Third-party and open source components often have dependencies on other components. A *transitive dependency* is when 
an application has a direct dependency on a component and that component has a dependency on another component. 
Transitive dependencies are common and are expected in highly modular ecosystems which values reuse over re-invent. 
Like any component, transitive dependencies have their own risk which is inherited by every component and application 
that relies on them. Components may additionally have specific runtime or environmental dependencies with implementation 
details not known or prescribed by the component. Component Analysis can aggregate the risk of all direct, transitive, 
runtime, and environmental dependencies providing a holistic view of inherited risk.

#### Project Health

There are many datapoints to consider when evaluating the health of an open source project.

  - Quality Controls and Metrics - The overall quality and controls for achieving and maintaining high-quality 
    components may be a factor in risk evaluation. For software components, this refers to the use of unit and 
    integration tests, linters and static analysis tools, the percentage of coverage, and results from various tools.
  - Community Engagement - The current and historical trend for a project and its maintainers to accept pull requests, 
    answer defect and enhancement requests, and engage in productive collaboration with the community may be a factor 
    in risk evaluation.
  - Vulnerability Analysis - Analyzing current and historical security vulnerabilities for timeline trends and for 
    root-cause patterns may signify a projects ability to protect the community from future (and similar) issues. 
    This activity may be a factor in risk evaluation.

## Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM)

Multiple efforts between government and industry are attempting to define *Software Transparency*. Some of these efforts 
will lead to increased compliance or regulatory requirements. Software Transparency is often achieved through the 
publishing of bill-of-materials (BOM). A BOM is synonymous to the list of ingredients in a recipe. Both are an
implementation of transparency.

Some Software Transparency efforts are focusing on Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOM) while others are more inclusive of 
all supply chain components. The [U.S. Food and Drug Administration](https://www.fda.gov/) (FDA) defines Cyber
Bill-of-Materials (CBOM) as:

> a list that includes but is not limited to commercial, open source, and off-the-shelf software and hardware 
> components that are or could become susceptible to vulnerabilities.

There are multiple SBOM standards including [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/), [SPDX](https://spdx.org/), and
[SWID](https://www.iso.org/standard/65666.html), each having their own strengths and use-cases they were designed to 
solve. Evaluating SBOM standards to determine which are applicable to an organizations requirements should be part of 
an overall C-SCRM strategy.

## Component Identification

Component ecosystems generally devise different terminology and formats for representing components. This self-imposed 
fragmentation makes uniquely identifying and representing components difficult when referring to them outside of their 
respective ecosystems. Centralized databases such as the [CPE Product Dictionary](https://nvd.nist.gov/products/cpe) 
maintained by [NIST](https://www.nist.gov/) adds additional fragmentation as the CPE vendor and product names often do 
not reflect reality.

Generally, a component will have a name and version. Components may optionally have a higher-level grouping identifier, 
commonly referred to as a groupId, organization, or vendor. When referencing components in a C-SCRM framework it is 
important to have a standard and uniform way to represent them. The [Package URL](https://github.com/package-url)
[specification](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec) provides a decentralized and uniform way to represent components.

```
    scheme:type/namespace/name@version?qualifiers#subpath
```

For example:
```
    pkg:deb/debian/curl@7.50.3-1?arch=i386&distro=jessie
    pkg:docker/cassandra@sha256:244fd47e07d1004f0aed9c
    pkg:gem/jruby-launcher@1.1.2?platform=java
    pkg:maven/org.apache.xmlgraphics/batik-anim@1.9.1?packaging=sources
    pkg:npm/%40angular/animation@12.3.1
    pkg:nuget/EnterpriseLibrary.Common@6.0.1304
    pkg:pypi/django@1.11.1
    pkg:rpm/fedora/curl@7.50.3-1.fc25?arch=i386&distro=fedora-25
```

## Open Source Policy

Open source policies provide guidance and governance to organizations looking to reduce third-party and open source 
risk. Policies typically include:

  - Restrictions on component age
  - Restrictions on outdated and EOL/EOS components
  - Prohibition of components with known vulnerabilities
  - Restrictions on public repository usage
  - Restrictions on acceptable licenses
  - Component update requirements
  - Blacklist of prohibited components and versions
  - Acceptable community contribution guidelines

While the open source policy is usually filled with restrictions, it provides an organizations security, development,
and legal teams an opportunity to create solutions for healthy open source usage.

## Recommendations

  - Limit the age of acceptable components to three years or less with exceptions being made for high-value, single 
    purpose components that are still relevant
  - Prohibit the use of end-of-life (EOL) components
  - Prohibit the use of components with known vulnerabilities. Update components that are exploitable with high to 
    moderate risk first.
  - Reduce the attack surface by excluding unnecessary direct and transitive dependencies
  - Reduce the number of suppliers and use the highest quality components from those suppliers
  - Standardize on a single component for each component function
  - Establish a maximum level of acceptable risk for public repositories. Utilize private repositories in lieu of 
    untrusted ones.
  - Automate component updates (from trusted repositories only)
  - Provide time-boxed allowances every sprint to maintain component hygiene
  - Establish a whitelist of acceptable licenses, a blacklist of prohibited licenses, and seek advice from counsel for 
    all other licenses
  - Automate the creation of software bill-of-materials (SBOM) for all deliverables
  - Leverage Package URL for describing components within SBOMs
  - Contractually require SBOMs from vendors and embed their acquisition in the procurement process
  - Automate the analysis of all third-party and open source components during Continuous Integration (CI), either by 
    analyzing the files themselves, or by analyzing a SBOM
  - Import SBOMs into systems capable of tracking, analyzing, and proactively monitoring all components used by every 
    asset in an environment (i.e. enterprise wide, entire cloud infrastructure, etc)
