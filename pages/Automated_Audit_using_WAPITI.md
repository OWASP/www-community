## Description

WAPITI is a simple command line to tool to automate the audit of a web
application. It's free and open source and has had some recent edits and
updates ([WAPITI homepage](http://wapiti.sourceforge.net/)). The
application is available for contribution at ([WAPITI
Repository](http://sourceforge.net/projects/wapiti/)).

Please be aware this command line does not replace a manual audit but
can be useful to perform a first validation or exploration of legacy
projects.

## Requirements

Python 2.6+

It is also recommended that you perform a build of the app:

python setup.py install

## Command

    python wapiti http://mysite.com -n 10 -b folder -u -v 1 -f html -o /tmp/scan_report

**Options used:**

  - \-n: Define a limit of urls to read with the same pattern (prevent
    endless loops), here limit to 10.
  - \-b: Set the scope of the scan, here we analyze all the links to the
    pages which are in the same domain as the URL passed.
  - \-u: Use color to highlight vulnerables parameters in output.
  - \-v: Define verbosity level, here we print each url.
  - \-f: Define report type, here we choose HTML format.
  - \-o: Define report destination, in our case it must be a directory
    because we choose HTML format.
