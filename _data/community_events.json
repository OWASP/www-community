        "description": "In an era of increasingly sophisticated threat actors, application security has become a critical concern for most organizations. This talk, \"Reducing Application Security Risk with ASPM (Application Security Posture Management),\" will explore the emerging role of ASPM in fortifying application security and accelerating DevSecOps and cloud native adoption.\n\nAttendees will gain insights into the current state of application security and DevSecOps adoption trends: challenges and opportunities across people, process, and technology. This also includes the impact of AI.\n\nThe talk will have a focus on ASPM and how it will help overcome some of the challenges and capitalize on the opportunities. We will delve into key ASPM features and how each of these use cases could be leveraged to solve common application security & DevSecOps adoption challenges and further mature your program. Through practical examples and case studies, the session will highlight best practices for implementing ASPM in large scale application development ecosystems to reduce application security risks. Whether you're a developer, security professional, manager or executive, this talk will equip you with actionable strategies to improve your application security posture and accelerate DevSecOps adoption."

Join us for networking with your peers and a featured talk from Andrius Useckas presenting:\n\n**AI Assisted Security Testing & A Glimpse into Security Challenges with Agentic LLM Deployments**\n\nPenetration testing is an ever-evolving field. In addition to legacy vulnerabilities affecting web applications and APIs, we are witnessing next generation of vulnerabilities emerging with Web 3.0 and agentic Large Language Model (LLM) systems. AI Assisted Security Testing represents a crucial evolution in cybersecurity defense, combining traditional security testing methods with artificial intelligence to enhance both coverage and efficiency. New approaches can process and analyze vast amounts of security data in real-time, prioritize threats based on risk levels, reduce false positives, and adapt to emerging attack vectors \u2013 all while helping security teams manage the growing shortage of skilled cybersecurity professionals and keep pace with DevSecOps requirements.\n\nSpecial thanks to the Rule4 Team for hosting and sponsoring, we couldn't do these events without our sponsors.

Although I have sat in on countless talks about empathy in the tech sector, the one thing ALL these talks miss is the language barrier when it comes to dealing with tech-savvy teams. If you are in a foreign country and cannot speak the language, it's going to be difficult to communicate regardless of the compassion in your heart. My unique art-&-technology background allows me to not only empathize with the strife of development teams, but helps facilitate a thriving pipeline of communication between security, developers and other hackers.\nIn this talk I will illuminate the perspective of a researcher participating in a bug bounty program, what to expect from researchers, and how to effectively escalate risks to development teams for remediation."

This lecture will analyze both the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) with particular attention to how these laws affect AI technologies and data management methods and the developing concept of federated learning. Participants will understand the fundamental concepts of the CCPA/CPRA including the rights of consumers and responsibilities of organizations handling data collection and processing activities. These regulations create substantial challenges for AI deployment because they require transparency in automated decision-making processes and proper use of consumer data.\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Now, emails and communications are sent quicker, code is written faster, and applications are built en masse. Business users are enabled and empowered in ways we never dreamed of even 12 months ago. Thanks to the injection of AI into essentially every business productivity tool, from email to business intelligence to application development, business users are able to get more done without needing IT or dev teams to get involved. However, as is often the case, productivity and ease can come at the expense of security if not controlled properly. As people are brought closer to technology through the use of Gen AI tools and Copilots, security teams are facing difficult decisions on whether to clamp down on the use of these tools, or staring down increased likelihoods of data leakage and exfiltration. For a long time, security has been seen as a business blocker, but the introduction of Gen AI is forcing a reset on organizations that presents an opportunity for security to act as a business enabler."

First our guest - Pedro Fortuna will introduce one of supply chain attacks - so called - resurected domains. Then we will host a discussion about how we can defend dependencies in our software to not be a victim of constantly growing supply chain attacks.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Dawn of the Dead - The Tale of the Resurrected Domains**\n*Pedro Fortuna (CTO at Jscrambler)*\nWeb applications\u2019 strengths\u2014composability, dynamic distribution, and error-tolerant runtimes\u2014also make them highly vulnerable to supply chain attacks. The heavy reliance on third-party dependencies, especially dynamically loaded scripts, introduces risks as these scripts can be updated without site owners\u2019 knowledge, bypassing integrity checks like SRI.\nA major concern arises when third-party script hosts go offline, leaving their domains up for grabs. Attackers have exploited this by acquiring such domains to inject malicious code into linked websites. In one case, over 1,000 websites were compromised before researchers detected and neutralized the threat.\nFollowing the incident, further research revealed the widespread nature of this attack vector, leading to the development of a tool capable of scanning millions of websites for similar vulnerabilities. The researchers also created a free tool to alert website owners if they are unknowingly using scripts from defunct, potentially hijacked domains. These findings and tools will be presented in the talk.\n\n2. After the break, we will host a discussion about supply chain defence.\n**Unpacking the Web Supply Chain: Trust, Risk, and the Future of Secure Development**\nIn today's fast-paced world of software development, how dependent have we become on third-party components? Has this reliance become more of a liability than an asset?\nIs a completely self-reliant software ecosystem even possible, or will external risks always be a fundamental part of modern development? With the rise of AI and LLMs, how are software creation processes changing? What new supply chain threats are emerging because of these advancements?\nAre traditional security measures like SBOMs, vulnerability management, and runtime security controls sufficient to address these evolving threats?\nWith dynamically updating scripts, lack of version control, gaps in CSP, SRI, and integrity monitoring, are enterprises sufficiently protected?\nCan we truly trust the browser environment, or are we vulnerable to manipulated content?\nWhat innovative strategies, like a zero-trust model, can better secure third-party JavaScript dependencies?\nLooking ahead, what concrete actions are needed to enhance software supply chain security? Is regulation the answer, or could it create more challenges? Should the industry implement a standardized \"seal of approval\" for third-party components? Are security vendors, enterprises, and regulators doing enough to tackle this growing threat landscape?\nJoin us as we challenge assumptions, explore emerging solutions, and outline a path forward in securing the software and web supply chain.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media."
