        "description": "In just a short span, AI Agents and low-code development have transformed how businesses operate, allowing users without coding backgrounds to create applications, automate processes, and streamline workflows. Business users are empowered as never before, using tools that merge AI with productivity\u2014from email and business intelligence to application development. But while these tools amplify efficiency, they also introduce new security risks that challenge the traditional boundaries of IT and AppSec.\n\nAs security teams grapple with vulnerabilities like authorization misuse, data leakage, and the risk of exfiltration, they must decide how to approach the widespread adoption of AI-driven tools and low-code platforms without stifling innovation. In this session, we\u2019ll explore recent research into the security challenges posed by AI agents and low-code development, emphasizing the pitfalls that emerge when business users become app creators. We\u2019ll also outline how AppSec teams can adapt their approaches to balance security with productivity, ensuring they enable the business rather than block it."

Now, emails and communications are sent quicker, code is written faster, and applications are built en masse. Business users are enabled and empowered in ways we never dreamed of even 12 months ago. Thanks to the injection of AI into essentially every business productivity tool, from email to business intelligence to application development, business users are able to get more done without needing IT or dev teams to get involved. However, as is often the case, productivity and ease can come at the expense of security if not controlled properly. As people are brought closer to technology through the use of Gen AI tools and Copilots, security teams are facing difficult decisions on whether to clamp down on the use of these tools, or staring down increased likelihoods of data leakage and exfiltration. For a long time, security has been seen as a business blocker, but the introduction of Gen AI is forcing a reset on organizations that presents an opportunity for security to act as a business enabler."

This talk will go over that journey, and how complicated it actually can be to get zero-leak secret injection in web apps, namely those using Docker Compose and Docker Swarm. Considerations for client-side secrets, server-side secrets, and more! Demos include showcasing source code, and possibly spooling up Docker containers and/or building web applications on a local environment. Likely pre-recorded.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Robert Babaev** is a recent graduate of Carleton University with an Honours Bachelor of Computer Science, specializing in Computer and Internet Security. He has done multiple internships at major Canadian cyber companies like Barracuda Networks and Software Secured, research into authentication and access control frameworks, and competed internationally in Athens and Prague in competitions through CyberSci.

First our guest - Pedro Fortuna will introduce one of supply chain attacks - so called - resurected domains. Then we will host a discussion about how we can defend dependencies in our software to not be a victim of constantly growing supply chain attacks.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Dawn of the Dead - The Tale of the Resurrected Domains**\n*Pedro Fortuna (CTO at Jscrambler)*\nWeb applications\u2019 strengths\u2014composability, dynamic distribution, and error-tolerant runtimes\u2014also make them highly vulnerable to supply chain attacks. The heavy reliance on third-party dependencies, especially dynamically loaded scripts, introduces risks as these scripts can be updated without site owners\u2019 knowledge, bypassing integrity checks like SRI.\nA major concern arises when third-party script hosts go offline, leaving their domains up for grabs. Attackers have exploited this by acquiring such domains to inject malicious code into linked websites. In one case, over 1,000 websites were compromised before researchers detected and neutralized the threat.\nFollowing the incident, further research revealed the widespread nature of this attack vector, leading to the development of a tool capable of scanning millions of websites for similar vulnerabilities. The researchers also created a free tool to alert website owners if they are unknowingly using scripts from defunct, potentially hijacked domains. These findings and tools will be presented in the talk.\n\n2. After the break, we will host a discussion about supply chain defence.\n**Unpacking the Web Supply Chain: Trust, Risk, and the Future of Secure Development**\nIn today's fast-paced world of software development, how dependent have we become on third-party components? Has this reliance become more of a liability than an asset?\nIs a completely self-reliant software ecosystem even possible, or will external risks always be a fundamental part of modern development? With the rise of AI and LLMs, how are software creation processes changing? What new supply chain threats are emerging because of these advancements?\nAre traditional security measures like SBOMs, vulnerability management, and runtime security controls sufficient to address these evolving threats?\nWith dynamically updating scripts, lack of version control, gaps in CSP, SRI, and integrity monitoring, are enterprises sufficiently protected?\nCan we truly trust the browser environment, or are we vulnerable to manipulated content?\nWhat innovative strategies, like a zero-trust model, can better secure third-party JavaScript dependencies?\nLooking ahead, what concrete actions are needed to enhance software supply chain security? Is regulation the answer, or could it create more challenges? Should the industry implement a standardized \"seal of approval\" for third-party components? Are security vendors, enterprises, and regulators doing enough to tackle this growing threat landscape?\nJoin us as we challenge assumptions, explore emerging solutions, and outline a path forward in securing the software and web supply chain.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media."

As a result, most smartphones are locked when distributed, and anti-reversing techniques are widely used. Consequently, millions of users use smartphones daily without a clear understanding of the software\u2019s functionality and purpose. To lower the bar for security researcher to analyze Android firmware, we developed a novel framework, called FirmwareDroid. In this talk, we discuss the challenges to automate the process of analyzing Android firmware and showcase how we use FirmwareDroid to analyse pre-installed Android apps in academia.\n* **Continuous Security with DevSecOps - by Romano Roth:** Security must be seamlessly integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This talk explores how combining DevSecOps principles with Platform Engineering empowers teams through automation, standardized environments, and reduced complexity. Learn how these approaches transform application security into a proactive, scalable, and collaborative enabler for delivering secure, high-quality software at speed."

Spacecraft such as satellites are vulnerable to cyberattacks that could disrupt operations, compromise data, or even cause physical damage. Malware and ransomware introduced into the software supply chain used in ground control systems can seriously impact mission-critical systems. The reliance on outdated or unpatched software in long-duration missions also increases vulnerabilities. Vulnerable systems could permit unauthorized access to satellite systems, resulting in adversaries taking control of spacecraft functions. To address these challenges robust and resilient cybersecurity frameworks that address software, hardware, and human threats are now more important than ever.\n\n**Bill** is a Staff Enterprise Architect MDA Space, and is responsible for\narchitecture and strategy in the areas of DevOps, Cloud, and Security in MDA Space\u2019s Geointelligence unit.
