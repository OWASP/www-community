        "description": "In the world of vulnerability research & exploit development, much of the public research and findings are primarily centered around the result of said research and activities. However, a lesser known and even lesser publicly talked about part of research is what happens when a bug is discovered where at that current time an abusable condition is not clearly present. What happens? Is this bug now worthless or not worth inspecting further? Many professional teams have a multitude of bugs to analyze specifically from fuzzing campaigns. This can cause teams to have to prioritize certain types of bugs over others, especially when looking for bugs that can lead to bypassing a specific mitigation. They don\u2019t have time to analyze every single bug in depth majority of the time.\u2028\u2028If you are curious about the world of vulnerability research and some of the methodology, this talk aims to help explain a common technique used among research teams where they hold onto potential mitigation breaking bugs in the hopes that in the future an abusable condition become available. We will walk through a real-world example of a bug within the Windows Kernel AFD driver discovered by VerSprite VS-Labs Research team.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\n\nRobert Hawes is the active Director of Research at VerSprite VS-Labs Research team. He Enjoys all things in the area of vulnerability research and exploit development. Robert is passionate about discovering zero-day vulnerabilities and developing accompanying exploits for advance capabilities. Robert is currently focused on userland, and kernel driver exploitation centered around the Windows operating system."

Many APIs are not routed through a proxy such as an API Gateway or Web Application Firewall (API);\n\ntherefore, those APIs are not monitored, audited, and may be vulnerable to mistakes or bad actors. Enterprise security teams are playing catch-up when it comes to API security. How are CISOs and security leadership developing governance round API security and incident response readiness?\n\nIn this talk, we will discuss:\n\n1.What are APIs?\n\n2.Why Should API security be top of mind to leadership?\n\n3.API breaches making headlines.\n\n4.API challenges\n\n5.API Breach Examples\n\n6.Approaches to API security\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n1\\. APIs are Everywhere\n\n2\\. How are APIs tied to business success?\n\n3\\. Why having an API strategy is important?\n\n4\\. How to develop API lifecycle management?"

        "description": "**TOPIC**: AppSec 2.0: Reimagine AppSec With Runtime Analysis\n\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by Kiran Kamity, CEO and Founder of Deepfactor.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: SCA tools (container and dependency scans) generate too much noise. Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, we will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications.\"\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Deepfactor](https://www.deepfactor.io/)*\n\n*Deepfactor Developer Security is a new approach to AppSec that is cloud-native and developer-friendly. It helps enterprises address supply chain and DevSecOps initiatives with a unique technology approach that combines SCA (Software Composition Analysis), SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) and Runtime Security.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Together they have 400 packages. When you run a container scan with an SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tool, you notice that 120 of them have vulnerabilities. Your security team is asking you to fix all the critical and high vulnerabilities, but your dev/DevOps team doesn\u2019t have the cycles. What do you do?\n\nToday, developers and DevOps engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and supply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d This session will focus on how security and engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Understanding runtime information can provide intelligence such as applicability of the CVE to the running environment, reachability, and usage. This session will focus on usage. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images.\n\nAs an example, the session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\n**Bio:**\n\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food.\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n6:00pm - 6:40pm Networking, Food & Drink\n\n6:40pm - 7:40pm Presentation\n\n7:40pm - 8:00pm Networking\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.
