        "description": "OWASP Aarhus and Danske Commodities are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup.\n\n19:00 \u2013 19:05 Welcome by Tobias Evar Lauridsen, Danske Commodities, and Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen, OWASP Aarhus\n\n19:05 \u2013 20:00 Frans aims to facilitate a case study centered around a simulated security breach, where participants will navigate a company through a security incident, emphasizing the management of employees, customers, authorities, and other stakeholders. This exercise will simulate a scenario where the participants must effectively handle the aftermath of a security breach, addressing concerns related to internal personnel, external clients, regulatory bodies, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThrough this simulation, Frans aims to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved and enable participants to apply effective strategies in real-world scenarios\n\nAbout Frans: Frans Skovholm is an attorney and partner at DAHL Law Partnership, responsible for DAHL's compliance team, which includes specialists in NIS2, ISMS, and Commercial compliance. Frans specializes in systematic risk management and advisory services related to ISMS management systems, including ISO 27001. He holds certification as an ISO 27001 Lead Implementer from PECB, which he applies in his consultation on information security law. Furthermore, he engages in work related to data protection law, assisting numerous companies in implementing internal regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 Overcoming the DevSecOps Imposter Syndrome by Michael Man, DevSecOps Evangelist and Community Leader, Veracode\n\nThe technology landscape is forever changing, and this is also reflective within the security field. As such, it is very overwhelming for people trying to break into the security domain and it is no difference for people who works in it. In this talk, I will share my perspective with how I had tackled this problem, how I drowned in the tsunami of information which impacted me mentally and tips for you to consider taking your first steps with your Continuous Learning journey.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\\- Admit to yourself that nobody knows it all\n\\- Be brave and ask those questions \\(others will be thankful\\)\n\\- Do not let the opinionated people overwhelm you\n\\- Techniques I use as part of my Continuous Learning\n\nAbout Michael: Michael brings more than 20 years of IT security experience. He has advised large enterprises on secure software development, working across all stages of delivery, while engaging with the different stakeholders to deliver successful business outcomes. His favourite certification is his OSCP due to his keen understanding of ethical hacking practices.

Mistakes that have been corrected in web application security have now returned as APIs aren\u2019t offered the same protections as they are usually out of the normal flow via security tooling such as WAFs. This means identifying and fixing flaws prior to production is important. This discussion will be around lessons learned from testing and breach data with an eye for prevention. This attendees will learn:\nApplication and API stacks are full of dangerous over-powered methods. These lurking menaces are built into libraries, frameworks, appservers, and runtime platforms. They do crazy things (from a security perspective) like start native processes, parse XML documents, evaluate expressions, and deserialize objects. And they are totally unprotected. Developers can use them without restriction, and attackers can target these binary Bambis without being detected or stopped. Unfortunately, the security of the entire digital ecosystem is entirely reliant on getting developers to take the right steps to use these methods safely\u2026 but it\u2019s way too hard.\n\n**Speaker:**\nJason Kent -- jason.kent@cequence.ai\n\nRSVP:\nhttps://owasp-austin-2024-february-g2.eventbrite.com - Eventbrite (in-person, Group 2)"

        "description": "Are you ready to dive into the world of vulnerability analysis? Join us for an exciting Hacker Days, where we'll explore \"Vulnerability Reachability Analysis using OSS Tools\"!. **Workshop is sponsored by [Deepfactor.io](https://www.deepfactor.io/)**.\nDon't miss this opportunity to expand your cybersecurity knowledge, enjoy fantastic food and drinks, and network with industry professionals!\n\nThis event is co-hosted with our partnering community [pacifichackers.org](https://www.meetup.com/pacifichackers/).\n\nDoors open at 5PM and workshop will be from 6 to 7.30PM\n\n## Abstract:\n\nNew vulnerabilities are disclosed every day in dependencies that you or your team may be using. But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This talk will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability - deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n## Speaker Bio:\n\nMike Larkin is CTO and co-founder of Deepfactor, Inc. Mike is also a contributor to OpenBSD, working on hypervisors, low-level platform code, and security. Mike is also an adjunct faculty member at San Jose State University, where he teaches application security technologies and virtualization.\n\n## Workshop Overview:\n\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n## Workshop Outline:\n\nI. Overview (10 minutes)\nA. Workshop organization\nB. About the tools and sample applications\n1. What are the tools and applications we are going to use?\nC. Obtaining/installing the tools and sample applications\n1. Cloning from the github repo\nD. Goals of the workshop (what you will learn)\n1. Be able to understand the importance of vulnerability\nreachability and how it helps prioritize remediation strategy\n2. Become familiar with some of the tools available to help with\nvulnerability reachability\n3. Learn where you can reach out to for more help in these areas\nafter the completion of the workshop\nII. Types of reachability analysis (10 minutes)\nA. Static analysis / call graphs\n1. What is a call graph?\n2. What information does a call graph provide to you\nB. Runtime analysis\nC. Language and environment considerations\n1. Things to consider when choosing a reachability analysis\nsolution\na. Types of applications being analyzed (COTS vs self-written)\nb. Availability of source code\nc. Robustness of test environment\nIII. Static call graph analysis exercise (20 minutes)\nA. Using static call graph analysis in IntelliJ/Eclipse to analyze a\nJava application\nB. Using Go callgraph to analyze a Go application\nC. How to correlate a call graph with an SBOM\nIV. Dynamic/runtime analysis exercise (20 minutes)\nA. Using a Java agent to analyze runtime reachability in a running\nJava application\nB. Using valgrind/KCacheGrind to analyze a running C/C++ application\nC. How to correlate runtime analysis with an SBOM\n\nV. Results comparison (10 minutes)\nA. Using the results of each exercise to determine if vulnerable\ncode was used\n1. How to use the output of each tool to understand what\nvulnerabilities need to be prioritized\nB. Benefits and limitations of each approach\n\nVI. Conclusion & Q&A (20 minutes)"

Throughout his career he has played several roles, contributing to the effective response of various entities to security, privacy and business continuity challenges. Founder and president of AP2SI, co-organizer of BSidesLisbon and active member of several associations, including OWASP, he is a committed professional dedicated to promoting good practices and knowledge of information security in Portuguese society.\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **SBOM, SBOM, you're an SBOM**\n\nSpeaker: **Diogo Sousa**\n\nAbstract:\nSoftware Bill of Materials (SBOM) is a concept that recently has been making waves in SDLC spaces but it isn't entirely new. Most mature languages have a (sometimes) mature package management system, either built-in (e.g., Rust's cargo) or de facto (e.g., Maven) that allows developers to define dependencies, resolve conflicts and do composition analysis.\n\nSBOMs, however, allow you to take this one step further, making it language-agnostic and allowing components from different ecosystems to use a common language for comparisons and analysis. However, we don't get those features out of the box. For example, consider common libraries in different package repositories - are all OpenSSL packages created equally and equivalent?\n\nOWASP is playing a part in this via its support for projects like CycloneDX which aims to provide a full-stack BOM standard to cover specific scopes such as the CBOM (Cryptography) and HBOM (Hardware) among others.\n\nThis shift towards software being more transparent and traceable is not without its detractors, as entire business models are predicated on customers using purely opaque boxes.\n\nIn the spirit of the topic, here is a Talk Bill of Topics:\n\n\\- Are BOM requirements burdensome?\n\\- Are we revealing too much of the \"secret sauce\"?\n\\- Does having an SBOM instantly make a piece of software more secure?\n\\- If we take a piece of software and replace every entry in its BOM with fully equivalent packages\\, one by one\\, is it still the same software in the end?\n\nThis talk targets a beginner to intermediate audience and will provide an overview of (S)BOMs, their ongoing challenges, and what they can bring to the table in terms of security.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with an interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

And forcing security onto developers often has an adverse effect. In this talk we will share the journey we have been making at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) to get Development teams to adopt DevSecOps in a way that works best for them. Topics that will be discussed include Secure Development training, Security Champions, Threat Modeling and using the right tooling.\n\n*Bio:*\nSebastiaan Rijnbout has a background as .NET developer and has worked in that field for over 12 years, but since 2017 he has started focusing on AppSec and Dev(Sec)Ops.\n\nWhen getting teams and organisations to adopt DevSecOps, Sebastiaan will look at all aspects of DevSecOps (People, Process and Technology) like setting up developer training programs and security champion programs, rolling out company-wide Security tooling and improving working processes. But always keeping a focus on making things easy and efficient for developers.\n\nIn his current role at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) Sebastiaan acts as Product Owner for 4 Dev(Sec)Ops support teams.

We propose a modern and effective method of detecting Powershell maliciousness, by using an LLM initially trained on code completion and characterization. We will explain the benefits of using a pre-trained model, different ways of adapting it to our task, and present the results. In particular, we will explain how we were able to use the trained model and ask it \"where it was wrong\", shedding lights on errors in the training datasets. Further, we'll explain where these errors came from, and how to improve the model iteratively by correcting them, allowing more people to reproduce our findings and fix pitfalls coming with noisy datasets. We will also discuss how you can define maliciousness depending on your objectives.\n\n**Speaker: Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Grelot**\n[bio forthcoming...]\n\n### **Title: Reflections on the past, present, future of the Toronto Security Community**\n\nMembers of TASK, Leading Cyber Ladies (LCL), OWASP, DC416 and ISC2 reflect on their experiences volunteering for the security community in Toronto, followed by an open discussion with the audience on what value we're looking for our communities to bring, and ways we can better, more flexibly serve the community we love.\n\n**Panelists:**\n\n* Nick Aleks: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-aleks-2b35389/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nick-aleks-2b35389/), DC416: [https://defcontoronto.com/](https://defcontoronto.com/)\n* Raphael Adeyemo: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-adeyemo/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/raphael-adeyemo/), ICS1: [https://isc2chapter-toronto.ca/](https://isc2chapter-toronto.ca/)\n* Opheliar Chan: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/opheliar-chan/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/opheliar-chan/), OWASP: [https://www.meetup.com/owasp-toronto/](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-toronto/)\n* Helen Oakley: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-oakley/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helen-oakley/), LCL: [https://www.meetup.com/Cyber-Ladies-Toronto/](https://www.meetup.com/Cyber-Ladies-Toronto/)\n* David Senf: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsenf/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsenf/),TASK: [https://task.to](https://task.to/)\n\nWith thanks for our sponsor [ASEC ](https://www.asec.io/)and host George Brown!"
