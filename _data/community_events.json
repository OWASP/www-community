In this talk, I will explain SAST, its significance, and introduce a framework that allows you to test and compare the latest SAST solutions. By the end, I hope to change your perspective on SAST.\n\nBio:\n\nGuillaume, co-founder of Bearer, developer-first security solution.

Specifically, it focuses on a deep dive into key security controls like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and explores associated risks with service accounts. Additionally, the talk presents a novel approach highlighting how an attacker could exploit Node authorization certificate keys to achieve long-term persistence within AKS environments and their underlying containers. Furthermore, the presentation describes and demonstrates an attack against a vulnerable Grafana enterprise application by leveraging directory traversal techniques to steal privileged tokens. These tokens serve as a stepping stone for further pivoting into the container environment. The talk also addresses the inherent shortcomings of default Azure Kubernetes deployments, including vulnerabilities related to secrets management, pod security admission, and underlying networks. By shedding light on these deficiencies, attendees gain a comprehensive understanding of the security challenges and potential avenues for improvement in AKS environments.\n\nBio:\n\nSadi Zane is a Principal Cyber Security Consultant specialising in offensive security, Red Team/Purple Team exercises, and extensive experience in Orchestration technologies e.g., Cloud on premise Kubernetes container security systems.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/)"

This instructor led hands-on workshop focuses on creating and running business logic tests using Akto. You will learn to write ten different business logic tests, which will then be executed against Juice Shop and other vulnerable apps. The goal of the workshop is to give hands-on experience in writing and automating custom API security tests related to authentication, authorization and access control issues. The workshop aims to be interactive, engaging, and an enriching learning experience. You will learn the fundamentals of writing, automating, and executing business logic tests. By the end of this training, participants will be able to automate 10 business logic tests, a key skill in the realm of API security.\n\nWhat to Expect?\n\n* By the end of the workshop participants will be able to write 10 business logic tests focused on authentication, authorization and access control issues.\n\n* Networking opportunity with fellow security professionals.\n\n* Ask absolutely any questions about securing APIs\n\nRequirements:\n\n* Attendees are required to bring their laptops\n\nParticipants are encouraged to bring their own API projects or sample APIs they are trying to test to receive personalized guidance and recommendations during the workshop. We will help everyone write their own custom tests during the workshop itself so you can test your own APIs. If not, we will be using Juice Shop or other vulnerable apps for demo purposes.\n\n**Food and drinks** will be provided and there's a free 90 minute **parking** available across the street."

Together they have 400 packages. When you run a container scan with an SCA (Software Composition Analysis) tool, you notice that 120 of them have vulnerabilities. Your security team is asking you to fix all the critical and high vulnerabilities, but your dev/DevOps team doesn\u2019t have the cycles. What do you do?\n\nToday, developers and DevOps engineers are being asked to address vulnerabilities and supply chain risks in container images. However, the volume of noisy security alerts often leads to developers ignoring them entirely or wasting valuable sprint time researching \u201cfalse positives.\u201d This session will focus on how security and engineering teams can correlate vulnerabilities with runtime information, prioritize alerts based on usage, and filter out false positives that don\u2019t represent a true exposure of a vulnerability. Understanding runtime information can provide intelligence such as applicability of the CVE to the running environment, reachability, and usage. This session will focus on usage. Prioritizing security updates to only used packages in your container image is a highly effective approach to reducing alert fatigue with your container scans. In addition, your DevOps team can even consider removing some of the unused packages and shrink your container images.\n\nAs an example, the session will include a demonstration of a typical SCA static container scan of a sample open-source test application and then show how an engineering team can filter alerts to reduce the number of vulnerable and used alerts that actually need to be fixed by developers by up to 90%.\n\n**Bio:**\n\nKiran Kamity is the Founder & CEO of Deepfactor. He is a serial Silicon Valley entrepreneur with a passion for building products that meet a need and make a business impact\u2014with Deepfactor that\u2019s empowering engineering teams to create secure cloud native applications. Prior to Deepfactor, Kiran was the Head of Product at Cisco Cloud BU, Founder/CEO at ContainerX (acquired by Cisco), and the Founder/VP at RingCube (acquired by Citrix). Kiran is a TEDx speaker and loves nature, travel, and food.\n\n**Schedule:**\n\n6:00pm - 6:40pm Networking, Food & Drink\n\n6:40pm - 7:40pm Presentation\n\n7:40pm - 8:00pm Networking\n\n### **Code of Conduct**\n\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.
