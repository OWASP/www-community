That mental model leads to confident failure: endless scanning, training, and compliance rituals that rarely stop real threats. In this talk, we\u2019ll re-examine AppSec\u2019s go-to tools \u2014 threat modeling, scanning, pentesting, firewalling \u2014 through a new lens, so you can see why they keep falling short. The problem isn\u2019t effort. It\u2019s context. You\u2019re trying to secure a living, breathing software city using a blueprint for a castle.\n\nWe\u2019ll introduce a new model: Runtime Security. This isn\u2019t theory \u2014 it\u2019s about observing real production environments, with real users, data, connections, and threats. We\u2019re not trying to secure a castle. Your application ecosystem is a massive, dynamic city \u2014 alive, interconnected, and always under construction. It needs monitoring, coordination, fast response, and resilience \u2014 not moats and silos. We\u2019ll show how teams are using runtime visibility and feedback loops to focus on what matters, adapt quickly, and prove they\u2019re making a difference. The most serious AppSec threat isn\u2019t in your code \u2014 it\u2019s in your head. Shift your thinking, and everything else starts to fall into place.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/)*\n*You can't stop what you can't see*\n*Application Detection and Response for Modern Enterprises*\n*Stop attacks in your applications and APIs from development to production*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

In this talk, I\u2019ll present a new approach that tackles these challenges by combining different learning strategies in an adaptive way. We\u2019ll explore how to start detecting fraud even when labeled examples are extremely limited and how we can prioritize the most suspicious cases using smart, explainable tools. The goal is to make fraud detection not just more accurate but also more efficient and easier to understand for human experts. Whether you're working in cybersecurity, finance, or just curious about the future of AI-powered decision-making, this talk will offer insights into how we can do more with less when fighting financial crime.\n\n***Beyond APIs: MCP Security for AI Integrations with Harsh Makwana****.*\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming the standard for LLM integration with external tools and data. However, this accelerated adoption has often sidelined crucial security hardening. This talk will directly address the inherent security challenges within MCP implementations, providing essential strategies to build robust, secure AI agents.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Bahar Emami Afshar** is in the process of completing their Master\u2019s in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, specializing in AI. During this time they worked under the supervision of Dr. Paula Branco and completed a research internship at H3M Analytics Inc. Their research focuses on explainable AI, anomaly detection, and label-efficient learning, with a particular emphasis on fraud detection and financial crime. Over the past year, Bahar has published several first-author papers exploring adaptive and efficient strategies for detecting fraud in low-label and imbalanced scenarios. Bahar is passionate about building intelligent systems that are more transparent, trustworthy, and impactful in real-world settings.\n\n**Harsh Makwana**, M.Eng, is an Application Security Consultant at Software Secured with over 3 years of experience in penetration testing. An alumnus of the University of Ottawa, Harsh is a general technologist with a strong interest in the advancements of both cybersecurity and industrial robotics. Outside of work, he enjoys exploring photography and illustration as creative pursuits."

Just good company.\n* Bring your own camping gear, food, and drinks.\n* Fire pit and picnic tables available.\n* Family and kids are welcome!\n* You *won\u2019t* have cell service, so enjoy the digital detox.\n* We will be close to both Washington and Trial lake so bring your rod and reel if you want to catch some mountain trout.\n* We will be at the tail end of the Perseid meteor shower, if it is a clear night we should have an amazing night of stargazing and shooting stars.\n\n### Logistics:\n\n* **Location:** The Washington Lake *Group Site* (not the main campground). We are at the Hoover camp site\n* There are no fees required for you, it is all paid for as part of the reservation for the campsite. You will drive past a fee station entering the national forest on the Mirror Lake Highway, but you do not need to stop.\n* Get off of the Mirror Lake Highway for Washington Lake. Follow the signs to the large group sites. There will be a gate in the road separating it from the normal campsites. You will need to open and close the gate behind you.\n* Pit toilets are available; however, there is **no water** on-site\u2014bring what you need!\n* The road is paved all the way\u2014no high-clearance needed.\n* We have space for 10 cars and room for room for **1 RV (max 20 feet)**.\n\nBring your hammock and marshmallows, and we\u2019ll see you there!"

This talk, \"Reducing Application Security Risk with ASPM (Application Security Posture Management),\" will explore the emerging role of ASPM in fortifying application security and accelerating DevSecOps and cloud native adoption by focusing on how to future-proof your approach for 2025 and beyond.\nSoftware development has undergone seismic shifts over the last 20 years: the Agile movement, the rise of DevOps and cloud native practices, and now the AI and generative development era. With AI code assistants and \u201cvibe coding\u201d on the rise, we\u2019re seeing faster delivery, along with new and complex risks. Over the last 10 years of the DevSecOps journey, shift-left has also achieved little success. Application Security needs a fundamental reset for the future. In this talk, we will discuss how modern approaches and technology innovations that are built to solve three of the biggest challenges in application security that must evolve for the AI Era \u2013 Speed, Coverage & Scale, and Context. We will explore three common scenarios:\n\n1\\. Inventory and Secure net new applications\n2\\. Reduce risk and volume of existing security backlog by prioritizing and fixing what matters\n3\\. Expand coverage to address emerging blind spots in AI\\-assisted application development\\."

This talk dissects how modern AI paradigms\u2014transformers (LLMs), agents, reinforcement learning (RL), RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), and the emerging RFT (Reinforcement Fine-Tuning)\u2014map to real AppSec problems. We\u2019ll explore which areas benefit from transformer-based reasoning, why RL has failed to disrupt AppSec, and how newer approaches may be able to improve human workflows without sacrificing explainability or trust. Leaders will walk away with a sharper mental model of which AI tools are production-ready for AppSec use cases."
