To ensure our apps and platforms are secure, we need to integrate security at all stages of our pipelines and ensure that our developers and engineering teams have tools and data with enable them to make decisions about security on an ongoing basis.

Ja, und zwar ganz getreu dem agilen DevSecOps-Sinne mittels \u201cThreat-Model-as-Code\u201d!</p> <p>Der Vortrag zeigt die Ideen hinter diesem Ansatz: Entwicklerfreundliches Bedrohungsmodellieren direkt aus der IDE heraus, ganz stilecht mit einer Live-Demo mittels Open-Source-Werkzeugen: In IDEs editierbare und in Git diff-bare Modelle, interaktive Modellerstellung, automatisch regel-basiert abgeleitete Risiken sowie grafische Diagramm- und Reportgenerierung inkl.

Es treffen sich Leute, die sich beruflich oder privat damit auseinandersetzen: Entwickler, Manager, \"Pentester\" und alle an (Web)sicherheit interessierte. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist offen und locker. Uns geht's um den Erfahrungsaustausch. Wer Produkte oder Dienstleistungen verkaufen will, ist hier falsch. Ihr k\u00f6nnt gerne Kollegen oder Bekannte den Hinweis auf unser Treffen weiterleiten.

Anyone who\u2019s been on-call on a Security team can remember how many hours they\u2019ve spent opening the same tabs, clicking the same buttons, copy+pasting the same indicator data and performing other similar tasks repeatedly. Imagine if that time was spent building stronger detection capabilities instead, or even better, on taking a break from the screen and going out for a walk!</p> <p>While this issue can be solved by outsourcing the frontline response capabilities, it is costly in terms of time and money to identify a proficient vendor, obtain approvals, finalize the contract, and pay for the service...</p> <p>What if I told you that at Segment, we built this capability with an open-source tool in the same amount of time it would take a team to do all of the above, with the time and resources of a single full-time security engineer?

At Telstra, Manual Secure Code Review is a great complement to the existing automated reviews using SAST and SCA technology. While the automated tools improve the scale and automation of security reviews, bugs still slip through the cracks and often times the tools just don't meet the expectations of either security folk or the developers they work with. Cole will be covering why Manual reviews are used, what the value they provide over a fully automated pipeline is, and how to perform your first one.</p> "
