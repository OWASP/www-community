In this talk, I will explain SAST, its significance, and introduce a framework that allows you to test and compare the latest SAST solutions. By the end, I hope to change your perspective on SAST.\n\nBio:\n\nGuillaume, co-founder of Bearer, developer-first security solution. Previously CTO and VP of Engineering at Skillsoft.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumemontard/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guillaumemontard/)\n\nTwitter: [https://twitter.com/g_montard]( https://twitter.com/g_montard)\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Unmasking Azure Kubernetes Service - Unveiling Inherent Security Risks in K8S Environments**\n\nSpeaker:\n\nSadi Zane\n\nAbstract:\n\nThis talk delves into the security risks associated with Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Specifically, it focuses on a deep dive into key security controls like Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and explores associated risks with service accounts. Additionally, the talk presents a novel approach highlighting how an attacker could exploit Node authorization certificate keys to achieve long-term persistence within AKS environments and their underlying containers. Furthermore, the presentation describes and demonstrates an attack against a vulnerable Grafana enterprise application by leveraging directory traversal techniques to steal privileged tokens. These tokens serve as a stepping stone for further pivoting into the container environment. The talk also addresses the inherent shortcomings of default Azure Kubernetes deployments, including vulnerabilities related to secrets management, pod security admission, and underlying networks. By shedding light on these deficiencies, attendees gain a comprehensive understanding of the security challenges and potential avenues for improvement in AKS environments.\n\nBio:\n\nSadi Zane is a Principal Cyber Security Consultant specialising in offensive security, Red Team/Purple Team exercises, and extensive experience in Orchestration technologies e.g., Cloud on premise Kubernetes container security systems.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadi-zane-bb6430206/)"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\n\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\n\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\n\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n\n4. Double Down on Automation\n\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\n\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\n\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\n\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

He has authored two open source projects, pwnSpoof and SMBeagle.\n\n**Talk Synopsis:** Unlike SAST and IAST, DAST can be a difficult tool to implement and configure in DevSecOps pipelines. In this session, we will explore why this is and what the real prerequisites are to getting meaningful results from DAST tooling.\n\nSimon will explore a few different DAST tools, including ZAP, and discuss how using functional testing scripts can help navigate your apps and drive out DAST findings.\n\nTalk 2\n\n**Title:** Securing your software supply chain\n\n**Speaker:** Jonny Brodie\n\n**Speaker Bio:** Jonny Brodie is Cloud Security Engineer, currently working in DevSecOps.\n\n**Talk Synopsis:** The ability to reuse opened sourced libraries and packages has given rise to rapid software development. This talk will discuss what we defined in code as part of DevOps and how we can secure that code. The talk will cover Application Code, Infrastructure as Code and Dockerfile configuration.\n\nAs always, tickets aren\u2019t required but help us gauge how much food to order.\n\nYou can also join our Google Group which is how we'll be sending out emails to events and is also going to be used as a forum for discussion.\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/a/owasp.org/forum/#!forum/newcastle-chapter"
