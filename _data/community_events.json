That mental model leads to confident failure: endless scanning, training, and compliance rituals that rarely stop real threats. In this talk, we\u2019ll re-examine AppSec\u2019s go-to tools \u2014 threat modeling, scanning, pentesting, firewalling \u2014 through a new lens, so you can see why they keep falling short. The problem isn\u2019t effort. It\u2019s context. You\u2019re trying to secure a living, breathing software city using a blueprint for a castle.\n\nWe\u2019ll introduce a new model: Runtime Security. This isn\u2019t theory \u2014 it\u2019s about observing real production environments, with real users, data, connections, and threats. We\u2019re not trying to secure a castle. Your application ecosystem is a massive, dynamic city \u2014 alive, interconnected, and always under construction. It needs monitoring, coordination, fast response, and resilience \u2014 not moats and silos. We\u2019ll show how teams are using runtime visibility and feedback loops to focus on what matters, adapt quickly, and prove they\u2019re making a difference. The most serious AppSec threat isn\u2019t in your code \u2014 it\u2019s in your head. Shift your thinking, and everything else starts to fall into place.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/)*\n*You can't stop what you can't see*\n*Application Detection and Response for Modern Enterprises*\n*Stop attacks in your applications and APIs from development to production*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

We look forward to seeing you for our August meetup.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Royal Stacks Bourke Street](https://maps.app.goo.gl/M2CwiyHGJnC2MWmv8) as our location for next month. On 6th August 2025 6PM, there we shall meet.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\n**If you're having trouble finding us**, send a message to [Dan on Signal](https://signal.me/#eu/4yti0PmJCFvXhLH_vmLcxO7Xy3VAM_yY9wRhOQCA1qn7UqWh1nFBa4rNCccfHyhW).\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

In this talk, I\u2019ll present a new approach that tackles these challenges by combining different learning strategies in an adaptive way. We\u2019ll explore how to start detecting fraud even when labeled examples are extremely limited and how we can prioritize the most suspicious cases using smart, explainable tools. The goal is to make fraud detection not just more accurate but also more efficient and easier to understand for human experts. Whether you're working in cybersecurity, finance, or just curious about the future of AI-powered decision-making, this talk will offer insights into how we can do more with less when fighting financial crime.\n\n*Beyond APIs: MCP Security for AI Integrations with Harsh Makwana.*\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming the standard for LLM integration with external tools and data. However, this accelerated adoption has often sidelined crucial security hardening. This talk will directly address the inherent security challenges within MCP implementations, providing essential strategies to build robust, secure AI agents.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Bahar Emami Afshar** is in the process of completing their Master\u2019s in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, specializing in AI. During this time they worked under the supervision of Dr. Paula Branco and completed a research internship at H3M Analytics Inc. Their research focuses on explainable AI, anomaly detection, and label-efficient learning, with a particular emphasis on fraud detection and financial crime. Over the past year, Bahar has published several first-author papers exploring adaptive and efficient strategies for detecting fraud in low-label and imbalanced scenarios. Bahar is passionate about building intelligent systems that are more transparent, trustworthy, and impactful in real-world settings.\n\n**Harsh Makwana**, M.Eng, is an Application Security Consultant at Software Secured with over 3 years of experience in penetration testing. An alumnus of the University of Ottawa, Harsh is a general technologist with a strong interest in the advancements of both cybersecurity and industrial robotics. Outside of work, he enjoys exploring photography and illustration as creative pursuits."

This talk dissects how modern AI paradigms\u2014transformers (LLMs), agents, reinforcement learning (RL), RLHF (Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback), and the emerging RFT (Reinforcement Fine-Tuning)\u2014map to real AppSec problems. We\u2019ll explore which areas benefit from transformer-based reasoning, why RL has failed to disrupt AppSec, and how newer approaches may be able to improve human workflows without sacrificing explainability or trust. Leaders will walk away with a sharper mental model of which AI tools are production-ready for AppSec use cases."
