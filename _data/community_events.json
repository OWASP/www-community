        "description": "This OWASP Aarhus meetup is co-hosted with the LEGO Group. By signing up, you consent to us sharing your name and email with the LEGO Group solely for the purpose of visitor pass registration.\n\nAgenda:\n**19:00 \u2013 19:10** Welcome by LEGO Group and OWASP Aarhus\n\n**19:10 \u2013 20:00** \"Detecting malicious beaconing in enterprise environments\" by Dr. Daniel Varga, LEGO Group\n\nAbout the presentation:\nCurrent beaconing detection methods rely on statistical metrics like skewness and median absolute deviation, often leading to high false positives. While newer approaches improve on this by considering e.g. jittering effects, these approaches lack a robust method for setting thresholds and the true positives usually get lost in the large number of false positive results. I propose using machine learning to distinguish C2 beaconing from legitimate traffic, leveraging enterprise logs and simulations to improve accuracy and compare detection methods.\n\n**20:00 \u2013 20:30** Networking break\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** \"Phishing: How Attackers Exploit the Human Mind and Behavior\" by Ahmed Morrad\n\nAbout the presentation:\nPhishing attacks are the most common method used by threat actors to gain initial unauthorized access. They are forms of cyber deception that prey on the human psychology. By exploiting emotions like curiosity or fear, attackers can manipulate individuals to submit sensitive information. During this presentation, it will be disclosed what phishing is, how threat actors turn human behavior into a weapon, what tools they use and how to mitigate these attacks."

Besonders moderne \u2013 oftmals auch komplexere \u2013 Projekte profitieren vom Einsatz entsprechender quelloffener Bibliotheken. Dabei wurden bestimmte Funktionen von einem 3rd Party Entwickler entwickelt und vorab (unentgeltlich) der Allgemeinheit zur Verf\u00fcgung gestellt. Dies bringt jedoch ein gro\u00dfes Risiko mit sich: Was passiert, wenn eine Sicherheitsl\u00fccke in genau einer solchen Bibliothek entdeckt wird? Je nach Einsatz und Tiefe der Integration kann dies schwerwiegende Auswirkungen haben und je nach Verbreitungsgrad der Open Source Komponente kann es eine Vielzahl von Anwendungen betreffen.\nDas OpenChain Projekt hat genau dieses Problem erkannt und ein ISO-Standard entwickelt, der sich dem Thema Informationssicherheit bei Open Source Projekten widmet. Dabei bekommen sowohl Entwickler von Open Source Komponenten, als auch Entwickler die diese einsetzen und sogar Firmen, die Open Source Software vertreiben die M\u00f6glichkeit den Umgang mit Informationssicherheitsvorf\u00e4llen zu zertifizieren.\nDieser Vortrag gibt ein \u00dcberblick \u00fcber die Norm ISO/IEC 18974 und die damit verbunden M\u00f6glichkeiten seinen Kunden oder Anwendern ein sicheres Vorgehen nachzuweisen.\n\n**Bitte gebt Bescheid**, wenn ihr kommt und ggf. wie viele Leute ihr mitbringt, damit wir auch genug Platz haben.\n\nDu hast eine Idee oder willst auch einen Talk halten?

To stay ahead, we must rethink how we defend our systems, manage risk, and make critical decisions.\n\nIn Lead with AI, Marcus J. Carey explores how artificial intelligence can be a force multiplier for cybersecurity professionals. Drawing from real-world experience, he demonstrates how AI-driven tools can enhance threat detection, automate incident response, and augment human expertise\u2014without replacing the need for skilled defenders.\n\nThis talk will break down practical ways to integrate AI into security operations, from streamlining workflows to improving threat intelligence analysis. Attendees will gain a deeper understanding of AI\u2019s strengths and limitations, ethical considerations, and how to build AI-driven strategies that empower security teams rather than overwhelm them.\n\nAI is already shaping the future of cybersecurity. The question isn\u2019t if we should use it, but how we can lead with it.\n\n***Speaker:***\n**Marcus Carey**\n\nIn-Person Tickets can be pulled from [Eventbrite ](https://owasp-austin-2025-march.eventbrite.com/)"

Great AppSec is really hard.\n\nOver almost 2 decades, Peter Chestna has consulted on and observed hundreds of AppSec programs. He's even built a few of my own. The similarities are striking and the impact and outcomes in these programs are stymied by common misconceptions about the goal of AppSec and the results we should be seeking.\n\nIn general, we find too much, fix too little, and do almost nothing to prevent new vulnerabilities. We have built a world where we attempt to report and goal our way to victory. How's that working for us? We need to rebalance our efforts across these three pillars and put the emphasis where it belongs. The accumulation of security debt is burying us all under a mountain of exception processing and annual recertification. Stop the madness!\n\nWhether you are a security leader or a development leader, Peter has practical guidance for you. In this presentation, Peter hopes to convince you that by shifting your current focus, you can drastically improve the results you get from your efforts.\n\nIn this talk, Peter will describe how to:\n\n1. Turn developers from adversaries to allies.\n2. Modify your controls to reflect reality and make compliance feel better\n3. Put the effort of your finite resources to places that will have the greatest impact\n4. Elevate your AppSec program to a level of excellence through effective developer engagement\n\nBy rebalancing efforts across these pillars, organizations can move beyond traditional challenges and create a more sustainable, impactful AppSec strategy.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n2nd topic forthcoming"

        "description": "G'day all,\n\nHappy new year! We're back into the swing of things. We found the \"Lean Coffee-style\" format worked well in 2024, so we're back with it once again as a place for AppSec practitioners to share their knowledge. We're looking forward to the AppSec discussions we had once again.\n\nWe're starting the year again at [YOI Indonesian Fusion](https://yoirestaurant.com.au/) as our location for April. On Wed, 2nd April 2025 6PM, there we shall meet. We aim to meet the 1st Wednesday every month from April to October.\n\n*There's NO BOOKING. If you're the first to arrive, please grab a table for the group and post a picture of the table's location in the comments of this meetup event. We'll use it to locate each other. (If you don't see a post, you're lucky first. Please grab us a table and post a pic. )*\n\n**Please remember to update your RSVP if you can no longer attend.** Even if it's just 30 minutes prior. It'll help whomever that arrives first know how big a table to get. We will take note of no-shows, and to make sure we've got space for those that do actually attend, your RSVP may be deprioritised for future events.\n\nSee you there.\n\nMore details on the format, and what to expect below:\n\n**The Practitioner's Roundtable**\nIt's a monthly meetup, for AppSec/ProdSec practitioners to participate discussing AppSec/ProdSec topics and share knowledge. There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is[ inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics. *You are expected to participate in the AppSec/ProdSec conversations constructively if you attend*. This isn't the place for BizDev focused conversations.\n\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there."

This method is able to handle complex abstractions introduced in high-level languages SwiftUI or Dart and generates output in popular programming languages like Swift, C#, Kotlin, Java, Python or even Bash.\n\n***II.* AI coding agents -Risks and Benefits-Endor Lab**\nThe proliferation of AI coding agents will accelerate the production of code, but what are the risks associated with this acceleration? In many ways the core challenge to securing these outputs will be the familiar fundamental challenges that appsec has always faced: maintaining an understanding of your inventory and risk-posture, conducting security assessments at scale, and managing processes for risk acceptance and remediation. Good appsec fundamentals will be critical in the new era of AI generated code. But coding agents also introduce novel concerns born from the inherent differences between these agents and human developers, as well the additional layers of abstraction which will become intrinsic to AI development: understanding how to vet and validate non-human agents, identifying the operational risks posed by agents trained on open-source, and the complexity of managing code developed through natural language will all require the development of new practices in appsec. This talk will look at some of the new risks that will arise in the era of large scale AI code development, and discuss possible paths forward for deploying such agents in a secure way.\n\n***III.*** **AppSec for AI AND NHI -GrayLog**\nAPPSEC FOR AI AND NHI - As we're empowering NHIs (**Non Human Identity**) to take on greater responsibilities, it's smart to wonder how we'll keep these good bots in bounds. This isn't possible to answer without acknowledging a dirty little secret -- while modern software is already driven by bots, modern security tools fall short in observing and regulating interactions between bots and APIs, whether those bots are trusted NHIs or malicious attackers. This session dispels a few myths about bots and bot detection and shows a few practical considerations and techniques to identify and block high-risk activities.\n\n***IV.*** **The Shadow AI and AppSec: What You Don\u2019t Know Will Get You!-ByteWhisper**\nThe over-the-top headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) have only been outstripped by the breakneck speed by which many are adopting AI to transform their organizations. Shadow AI creates significant security exposures, like development teams processing sensitive customer data through unauthorized AI tools for creating mission-critical solutions using unvetted open-source AI models. This session will focus on where Shadow AI and appsec intersect \u2013 the coding co-pilots, the platforms, and the risks that they represent to your organization. This session will provide an overview of Shadow AI, how application development might unknowingly create Shadow AI, and tools to identify and mitigate Shadow AI."

This talk introduces the basic technologies behind EV charging infrastructure, and two novel attack methods: one for scanning electric chargers using an unmodified consumer Ethernet power line adapter and another for launching a Denial of Service (DoS) attack with the same tool.\n\n#### Talk 2- Poor state of InfoSec tooling\n\n**Speaker:** Sean Wright\n\n**Blurb:** In this talk I'll cover the poor state of many of the security toolsets. Why we need to start holding vendors to account and why we need to look beyond the hype of tooling when choosing tools. This will be an interactive talk as well.\n\n#### Talk 3 \u2013 All these secrets...\n\n**Speaker:** Rob Jansson\n\n**Blurb:** In this talk, we'll explore the risks associated with the leakage of 'secrets', such as passwords, API keys, and more, within an organisation's integrations including version control systems, artifact repositories, CI / CD pipelines, chat apps and ticketing systems to name a few... We'll also dive into possible strategies and tools for detecting and preventing these vulnerabilities, to help safeguard your systems and organisation from external threat actors and malicious insiders."

What does that mean for AppSec?\n* 1:00pm - Depart\n\n**Speaker**:\nChris Fago is a cybersecurity sales guy at Zenity with a knack for pretending to be more technical than he probably should.\n\nAt Zenity he's focused on helping solve the emerging security challenges tied to AI agents and low-code development\u2014showing enterprises \u201cHow to fail at AppSec\u201d or what didn\u2019t work for others so they can close gaps often overlooked by traditional security tools in this new threat vector.\n\nPreviously, as a founding team member of Prisma Cloud (now part of Palo Alto Networks), he helped grow it into a market-leading CNAPP. During that time, Chris worked with major U.S. brands on complex digital transformations, helping them secure their cloud migrations and maybe even picking up a thing or two about Kubernetes.\n\nOutside of work, Chris loves spending time with his family, hanging out at Atlanta\u2019s botanical gardens and aquarium, obsessing over UFOs, and staying hopelessly devoted to Atlanta\u2019s sports teams (despite the emotional toll they consistently deliver).\n\n**Abstract**:\n**AI is here for business users. What does that mean for AppSec?**\nGone are the days when coding skills were needed to create apps, automate processes, or reduce manual tasks. With AI now embedded in tools like email, business intelligence, and app development, business users can accomplish more without relying on IT or dev teams. However, this boost in productivity can come at the expense of security if not properly managed. As Gen AI, Copilots, and Agentic AI bring users closer to technology, security teams face tough choices: limit tool usage or risk data leakage. Traditionally seen as blockers, security teams now have the chance to transform into business enablers thanks to AI.\n\n**Location**:\nGuidePoint Security\n3030 N Rocky Point Dr W,\nSTE 600\nTampa, FL\n33607\n\n**Sponsors**:\nZenity - [https://www.zenity.io/](https://www.zenity.io/)"
