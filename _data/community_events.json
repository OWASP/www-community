        "description": "OWASP Aarhus and Danske Commodities are happy to invite you to this OWASP Aarhus meetup.\n\n19:00 \u2013 19:05 Welcome by Tobias Evar Lauridsen, Danske Commodities, and Thomas Ljungberg Kristensen, OWASP Aarhus\n\n19:05 \u2013 20:00 Frans aims to facilitate a case study centered around a simulated security breach, where participants will navigate a company through a security incident, emphasizing the management of employees, customers, authorities, and other stakeholders. This exercise will simulate a scenario where the participants must effectively handle the aftermath of a security breach, addressing concerns related to internal personnel, external clients, regulatory bodies, and other relevant stakeholders.\n\nThrough this simulation, Frans aims to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved and enable participants to apply effective strategies in real-world scenarios\n\nAbout Frans: Frans Skovholm is an attorney and partner at DAHL Law Partnership, responsible for DAHL's compliance team, which includes specialists in NIS2, ISMS, and Commercial compliance. Frans specializes in systematic risk management and advisory services related to ISMS management systems, including ISO 27001. He holds certification as an ISO 27001 Lead Implementer from PECB, which he applies in his consultation on information security law. Furthermore, he engages in work related to data protection law, assisting numerous companies in implementing internal regulations to ensure compliance with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n\n20:00 \u2013 20:30 Networking break\n\n20:30 \u2013 21:25 Overcoming the DevSecOps Imposter Syndrome by Michael Man, DevSecOps Evangelist and Community Leader, Veracode\n\nThe technology landscape is forever changing, and this is also reflective within the security field. As such, it is very overwhelming for people trying to break into the security domain and it is no difference for people who works in it. In this talk, I will share my perspective with how I had tackled this problem, how I drowned in the tsunami of information which impacted me mentally and tips for you to consider taking your first steps with your Continuous Learning journey.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\\- Admit to yourself that nobody knows it all\n\\- Be brave and ask those questions \\(others will be thankful\\)\n\\- Do not let the opinionated people overwhelm you\n\\- Techniques I use as part of my Continuous Learning\n\nAbout Michael: Michael brings more than 20 years of IT security experience. He has advised large enterprises on secure software development, working across all stages of delivery, while engaging with the different stakeholders to deliver successful business outcomes. His favourite certification is his OSCP due to his keen understanding of ethical hacking practices. Michael is also the founder of one of the largest DevSecOps community meetups \u201cDevSecOps - London Gathering\u201d and has co-organised the conference \u201cDevSecOps Days London\u201d.\n\n21:15 \u2013 21:30 Closing notes and goodbyes"

Mistakes that have been corrected in web application security have now returned as APIs aren\u2019t offered the same protections as they are usually out of the normal flow via security tooling such as WAFs. This means identifying and fixing flaws prior to production is important. This discussion will be around lessons learned from testing and breach data with an eye for prevention. This attendees will learn:\nApplication and API stacks are full of dangerous over-powered methods. These lurking menaces are built into libraries, frameworks, appservers, and runtime platforms. They do crazy things (from a security perspective) like start native processes, parse XML documents, evaluate expressions, and deserialize objects. And they are totally unprotected. Developers can use them without restriction, and attackers can target these binary Bambis without being detected or stopped. Unfortunately, the security of the entire digital ecosystem is entirely reliant on getting developers to take the right steps to use these methods safely\u2026 but it\u2019s way too hard.\n\n**Speaker:**\nJason Kent -- jason.kent@cequence.ai\n\nRSVP:\nhttps://owasp-austin-2024-february.eventbrite.com -- Eventbrite(in-person)"

Most mature languages have a (sometimes) mature package management system, either built-in (e.g., Rust's cargo) or de facto (e.g., Maven) that allows developers to define dependencies, resolve conflicts and do composition analysis.\n\nSBOMs, however, allow you to take this one step further, making it language-agnostic and allowing components from different ecosystems to use a common language for comparisons and analysis. However, we don't get those features out of the box. For example, consider common libraries in different package repositories - are all OpenSSL packages created equally and equivalent?\n\nOWASP is playing a part in this via its support for projects like CycloneDX which aims to provide a full-stack BOM standard to cover specific scopes such as the CBOM (Cryptography) and HBOM (Hardware) among others.\n\nThis shift towards software being more transparent and traceable is not without its detractors, as entire business models are predicated on customers using purely opaque boxes.\n\nIn the spirit of the topic, here is a Talk Bill of Topics:\n\n\\- Are BOM requirements burdensome?\n\\- Are we revealing too much of the \"secret sauce\"?\n\\- Does having an SBOM instantly make a piece of software more secure?\n\\- If we take a piece of software and replace every entry in its BOM with fully equivalent packages\\, one by one\\, is it still the same software in the end?\n\nThis talk targets a beginner to intermediate audience and will provide an overview of (S)BOMs, their ongoing challenges, and what they can bring to the table in terms of security.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with an interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

Turns out, reducing vulnerability risk to a single score or generic category removes much-needed context, these metrics are meant to guide, not be the end-all in the prioritization process. Join us in this presentation as we explore practical strategies on how to effectively use the variety of risk indicators for swift and accurate vulnerability prioritization.\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Originally written by Ivan Risti\u0107, it was acquired by Trustwave and then developed for over 10 years by Trustwave\u2019s SpiderLabs.\n\nModSecurity exists as a module for the Apache HTTP Server, Nginx, and IIS (v2) and it has also been released as standalone daemon for NGINX (v3), accessible via an API and a webserver specific connector module. It is able to inspect HTTP requests and HTTP responses and it configured via rules in a rather cumbersome config language called \u201cSecLang\u201d. OWASP CRS is the dominant rules project used by most ModSecurity users.\n\nIn 2021, Trustwave announced the end of support and the plan to hand over ModSecurity into the hands of the community by Summer 2024. OWASP tried to convince Trustwave to hand it over to the foundation several times, but only succeeded in November 2023. A plan was thus drawn and a new project was prepared from December 2023. The main repository was transferred on January 25 and OWASP ModSecurity was declared a \u201cproduction level\u201d OWASP project by the OWASP project committee.\n\nThe new project operates with a preliminary leader team, the first release is already out and the community is growing, all in line with the 3-6 month project plan drawn up in December 2023.\n\nThis talk gives an overview of this dynamics at play, how OWASP operates on projects like this and the perspectives are for ModSecurity and OWASP as a whole.\n\n*Bio:*\nDr. Christian Folini is a Swiss security engineer and open source enthusiast. He brings 15 years of experience with ModSecurity configuration in high security environments, DDoS defense and threat modeling. Christian Folini is the author of the 2nd edition of the ModSecurity Handbook and the best known teacher on the subject. He co-leads the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set project and serves as the program chair of the \u201cSwiss Cyber Storm\u201d conference.\n\n**OWASP Dependency-Track**\n*Abstract:*\nSince its inception over a decade ago, OWASP Dependency-Track has pioneered many concepts in the realm of software supply chain security, and software bill of materials (SBOM).\n\nWith increasingly more governments, regulators and organizations asking for SBOMs, the project is more relevant than ever. On the other hand, a non-negligible portion of folks is still puzzled as to what to even do with SBOMs once they have them.\n\nIn this talk, we\u2019ll explore what Dependency-Track is, how it can help organizations in identifying and reducing risk in their software supply chain, and give an outlook into what\u2019s next!\n\n*Bio:*\nAfter years as Security Engineer for a large European payment service provider, Niklas currently works as Cloud Native Engineer for ControlPlane. He is passionate about AppSec, DevSecOps and Open Source. He co-leads the OWASP Dependency-Track project and is a contributor to the OWASP CycloneDX Bill of Materials standard, for which he maintains the official Go tooling."

Kubernetes is no different. To be clear, this isn\u2019t a value judgment. Kubernetes is an amazing open-source project made up of the contributions of thousands of people. Why Kubernetes is the way it is by default makes sense\u2014we want it to be as easy to use as possible to start. As well, there were particular design decisions made that impact how we think about security in Kubernetes. Unfortunately, security is a trade-off, and ultimately, we need to undo the insecure by default stance and implement some level of security. But at what level? What changes? And where? In this talk, we\u2019ll discuss three major areas where we can make some positive security trade-offs to vastly improve the baseline level of security in Kubernetes without overly affecting ease of use or user expectations; a way that we can create a new baseline to build on. This talk would demo setting up open source automation to configure Kubernetes to have a default level of security, as well as using Falco for threat detection as a last line of defence.\n\n**Speaker:**\nCurtis Collicutt works to make complicated software and systems safer and easier to use. He has spent his career managing complex infrastructure and applications, working to make them reliable and secure through the principles of automation and organisational models such as DevOps. Curtis approaches his work from a socio-technical perspective, believing that it's not just about what technology can do, but how we use it, and that we'll be both safer and more productive if we approach difficult problems like cybersecurity through a human-centric lens. Currently he works at Sysdig helping customers achieve cybersecurity outcomes."

We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur February host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter.\n\n*[This was our January event, which was canceled for weather.

The talks will also be streamed online from 18:00.\n\n**Architecting web applications to achieve DDoS resiliency - [Johan Aldor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanaldor/)**\nIn this session, [Johan Aldor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/johanaldor/), Senior Solutions Engineer from Akamai will cover how to architect web applications to achieve DDoS resiliency. DDoS attacks are getting more common and also bigger, if you don\u2019t architecture your web application correctly, coping with attacks can be a hassle. Akamai has over 25 years of experience in running distributed systems and overlay networks. Join us in this session where we share the benefits of using a distributed architecture for DNS, Web Application Firewalls and datacenter protection that will make you ready for any attack.\n\n**API Security is NOT Appsec - [Alexander Cedergren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acedergr/)**\nAPI Security has become a hot topic and this is what you need to know about it. OWASP recently released the updated OWASP Top 10 API Security Risks, and to be secure you need to rethink your normal security strategy. Join [Alexander Cedergren](https://www.linkedin.com/in/acedergr/), Senior Solutions Engineer at Akamai to learn more about why API Security is NOT AppSec, and what needs to be done different now when APIs is dominating the modern world."
