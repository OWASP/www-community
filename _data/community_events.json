        "description": "In just a short span, AI Agents and low-code development have transformed how businesses operate, allowing users without coding backgrounds to create applications, automate processes, and streamline workflows. Business users are empowered as never before, using tools that merge AI with productivity\u2014from email and business intelligence to application development. But while these tools amplify efficiency, they also introduce new security risks that challenge the traditional boundaries of IT and AppSec.\n\nAs security teams grapple with vulnerabilities like authorization misuse, data leakage, and the risk of exfiltration, they must decide how to approach the widespread adoption of AI-driven tools and low-code platforms without stifling innovation. In this session, we\u2019ll explore recent research into the security challenges posed by AI agents and low-code development, emphasizing the pitfalls that emerge when business users become app creators. We\u2019ll also outline how AppSec teams can adapt their approaches to balance security with productivity, ensuring they enable the business rather than block it."

        "description": "Gone are the days where you needed to have a coding background in order to create apps, automate processes, or reduce the need for manual tasks. Now, emails and communications are sent quicker, code is written faster, and applications are built en masse. Business users are enabled and empowered in ways we never dreamed of even 12 months ago. Thanks to the injection of AI into essentially every business productivity tool, from email to business intelligence to application development, business users are able to get more done without needing IT or dev teams to get involved. However, as is often the case, productivity and ease can come at the expense of security if not controlled properly. As people are brought closer to technology through the use of Gen AI tools and Copilots, security teams are facing difficult decisions on whether to clamp down on the use of these tools, or staring down increased likelihoods of data leakage and exfiltration. For a long time, security has been seen as a business blocker, but the introduction of Gen AI is forcing a reset on organizations that presents an opportunity for security to act as a business enabler."

This approach fits well with frameworks like TIBER, which focus on creating realistic simulations of cyber threats. It\u2019s all about making our defenses stronger and more effective! AI algorithms effectively analyze large datasets to identify emerging threats and tactics, aiding in realistic attack simulations. AI-driven tools help replicate complex attacks, providing red teams with thorough assessments of security measures. Using AI-generated anomalies enhances detection capabilities and strengthens incident response plans. However, the integration of AI into red teaming is not without challenges. This discussion aims to provide a nuanced overview of the application of AI in red teaming exercises, examining its potential benefits and limitations within established frameworks like TIBER. By critically evaluating this integration, we can better understand how to harness AI\u2019s capabilities to strengthen cybersecurity offense and defense.\n*Bio:*\nAli is a cybersecurity researcher with over 12 years of experience. Currently, he is the application and offensive security manager at Canon EMEA. He studied computer engineering, published articles, and holds several professional certificates. Ali is a Microsoft MVP and regular speaker or trainer at industry conferences and events.\n\n**Behind the Breach: Understanding and Preventing Web Vulnerabilities**\n*Abstract:*\n\u201cBehind the Breach: Understanding and Preventing Web Vulnerabilities delves into the transformation of modern web applications and architecture, showcasing how advancements in frameworks and browser technologies have revolutionized security. Yet, even with these innovations, attackers persist in uncovering and exploiting vulnerabilities. Drawing from real-world case studies across industries\u2014from agile startups to global enterprises\u2014this presentation not only demonstrates how a deeper understanding of security can thwart these threats, but also highlights how effectively conveying the potential impact of vulnerabilities is key to prioritizing security efforts.\u201d\n*Bio:*\nMitchel Koster is the Chief Security Researcher at Breachlock, where he leads the development of new security products and conducts research and engagements for high-profile clients. His work includes Red and Purple Team exercises and addressing custom security requirements across diverse sectors, including Aviation and Healthcare. With a background in computer science, embedded systems, and programming, Mitchel bridges the gap between modern software development practices and robust security measures.\n\nFor parking, there\u2019s a (paid) parking space less than 5 minutes away at the Q-Park Hermitage.

This presentation explores the intersection of AI and OT/ICS, discussing the benefits and challenges of implementing AI-powered defenses in industrial control systems.\n\n*Are We Leak-Free Yet? Securing Production App Secrets with Robert Babaev*\nA month or so ago, I was fiddling with ways of getting secret values (API keys, database URLs, etc.) into an application without leaking them. This talk will go over that journey, and how complicated it actually can be to get zero-leak secret injection in web apps, namely those using Docker Compose and Docker Swarm. Considerations for client-side secrets, server-side secrets, and more! Demos include showcasing source code, and possibly spooling up Docker containers and/or building web applications on a local environment. Likely pre-recorded.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Kay Oblassi**\nKayode is a seasoned professional with over a decade of experience in financial services, consulting, and Cyber GRC. He is the Founder of Aidrome Inc., an IT firm that aims to leverage AI for digital transformation across various sectors, including ICS/OT Cybersecurity.\n\n**Robert Babaev**\nRobert Babaev is a recent graduate of Carleton University with an Honours Bachelor of Computer Science, specializing in Computer and Internet Security. He has done multiple internships at major Canadian cyber companies like Barracuda Networks and Software Secured, research into authentication and access control frameworks, and competed internationally in Athens and Prague in competitions through CyberSci. Robert also regularly engages in side projects including CourseFull, an app built to help students track their academic goals without the guesswork."

        "description": "Join us at the OWASP Switzerland Community Meetup to kick off the year 2025! This meetup will feature two exciting talks on application security. It\u2019s a fantastic opportunity to network with like-minded professionals, exchange ideas, and expand your knowledge in a friendly and collaborative environment.\n\n**Program:**\n**17:10** - **Doors open**: Grab a drink, meet old and new friends from the OWASP Switzerland community\n\n**17:35** - **Uninstallable by Design**: The Role of Pre-installed Apps in Android\u2019s Security Landscape - (Thomas Sutter, PhD Student @ University of Bern)\n\n**18:30** - **Coffee Break**\n\n**18:45** - **Continuous Security with DevSecOps**: How Platform Engineering Transforms Modern Application Security\u200b - (Romano Roth, Chief of DevOps / Partner @ Z\u00fchlke)\n\n**19:40 - 20:10 - Drinks, Fingerfood and Networking:** Grab a bite and chat with old and new friends\n\n**Talk details:**\n\n* **Uninstallable by Design - by Thomas Sutter**: The competitive smartphone market is keen to prevent its intellectual property from being analysed by competitors and the public. As a result, most smartphones are locked when distributed, and anti-reversing techniques are widely used. Consequently, millions of users use smartphones daily without a clear understanding of the software\u2019s functionality and purpose. To lower the bar for security researcher to analyze Android firmware, we developed a novel framework, called FirmwareDroid. In this talk, we discuss the challenges to automate the process of analyzing Android firmware and showcase how we use FirmwareDroid to analyse pre-installed Android apps in academia.\n* **Continuous Security with DevSecOps - by Romano Roth:** Security must be seamlessly integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle. This talk explores how combining DevSecOps principles with Platform Engineering empowers teams through automation, standardized environments, and reduced complexity. Learn how these approaches transform application security into a proactive, scalable, and collaborative enabler for delivering secure, high-quality software at speed."
