At Telstra, Manual Secure Code Review is a great complement to the existing automated reviews using SAST and SCA technology. While the automated tools improve the scale and automation of security reviews, bugs still slip through the cracks and often times the tools just don't meet the expectations of either security folk or the developers they work with. Cole will be covering why Manual reviews are used, what the value they provide over a fully automated pipeline is, and how to perform your first one.</p> "
