The supply chain is at the heart of developing, delivering, maintaining, and scaling applications. It is critical to understand the risk in each component in order to safeguard the supply chain. End-to-end security is critical to mitigating the risks associated with open source software, regardless of the application that is being created.\nIn this talk, we will look at the challenges associated with the \"Container\" supply chain, as well as some of the technology, processes, and tools that you can use to create confidence in your container supply chain.\n\n**Talk#2** : **Every risk is not a CVE: Bolster up against software supply chain attacks**\n\n###\n\n**Speaker:** Varun Badhwar, Founder/CEO of Endor Labs\n3rd party and open source software components are both desired and indispensable ingredients used throughout the development lifecycle, but their consumption comes with considerable security risks, both for the developer herself and her downstream users. The rise of corresponding security incidents demonstrates that adversaries discovered those attack vectors as a viable and scalable attack pattern.\n\nWe will present a comprehensive, comprehensible and technology-agnostic[ ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.04008)taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents, and validated by experts in the domain. An interactive visualization of this taxonomy,[ ](https://riskexplorer.endorlabs.com/)available as open source itself, will be demoed throughout the talk to explain different techniques at the disposal of attackers, supported by real-world examples.\n\nFollowing, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks.\n\nLooking forward to connecting at the Security Meetup"

As vendors continue to acquire and build new features, feature parity is on the horizon. For now, they're doing things in their own unique, sometimes odd way.\n\nOver the last few years, Raafey has used, analysed and compared various AppSec tooling. Running them against benchmarks and multiple applications.\nIn this talk, he will go through what makes an AST tool good, why there are SO many false positives, and when they actually make sense to use compared to a good old-fashioned pentest.\n\n**Bio:** Raafey has been a security consultant for many years and leads the AppSec team for CyberCX. His primary focus is working with organisations to understand how they build software and what they can do to make sure they\u2019re protected.\n\nHaving recently moved over from NZ, he\u2019s looking forward to getting to know the Brisbane security community."

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cAutomation of digital crime investigation using Reinforcement Learning (RL)\u201d**\n\nCurrent human-led Digital Investigation is reaching its limit, notably with the explosive increase in cybercrime. DFIR practitioners at law enforcement and corporate levels are facing severe challenges in coping with the demand. This talk will discuss the possible use of new Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches to automate and optimise some of the processes in DFIR practice and thus off-load experts and increase efficiency.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

I\u2019m passionate about software security. The niche I am currently working on is engineering processes, tools, and internal interfaces to help companies secure their development lifecycles, do vulnerability management and increase overall awareness of the product's security risks.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nTitle: **Is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion**\n\nSpeaker:\nFrancisco Santos\n\nAbstract:\nBy 2021, the number of components in the average application rose 77 % from 298 to more than 500 open-source packages. Those components are hosted on public repositories such as GitHub, NPM, or PyPI, while some organizations choose to operate proprietary packages inside private registries of those repositories. Private or public, the management is done by CLI (like npm). The CLI imports private or public packages via a simple precedence algorithm: If the package resides inside the private registry, import it. If not, import the public component. How can a bad actor play this to his advantage?\nThe \"is it private, is it public? Dependency Confusion\" talk explains what dependency confusion is, and teaches ways of finding dependency confusion vulnerabilities in js files via BurpSuite with an automated tool called jsminer, a real example of a dependency confusion bug I found, and recommendations to mitigate those issues. By the end, breakers and makers should acquire a fresh new perspective on this issue.\n\n[Francisco Santos](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francisco-santos-77917a210/) Bio:\nI'm Francisco Santos, 23 years old. I always liked to think out of the box and find weird solutions to problems. I like logic and solving puzzles. I enjoy being a breaker, and I want to add value to that community.\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/andr0idp4r4n0id"

The rise of corresponding security incidents demonstrates that adversaries discovered those attack vectors as a viable and scalable attack pattern.\nWe will present a comprehensive, comprehensible and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents, and validated by experts in the domain. An interactive visualization of this taxonomy, available as open source itself, will be demoed throughout the talk to explain different techniques at the disposal of attackers, supported by real-world examples.\nFollowing, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: Endor Labs\nEndor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise.
