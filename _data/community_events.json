Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment.

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment.

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

        "description": "Title:\n\nZero Trust for API Security and Legal Risk Management\n\nDescription:\n\nWeb applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

        "description": "Love them or hate them, passwords have become part of our daily life. We use them to sign into just about everything, from our devices to emails, social media, cloud services and digital banking. We have to remember different passwords for each site we need to log-in to, and we are forced to change them on occasion. It can be a lot to remember. Password Managers can help and 2FA or MFA can provide extra security. Yet despite all that, service providers can still be compromised and our carefully chosen passwords can end up somewhere on the darkweb being sold by the hundred thousand.\n\nMaking use of both slides and live demonstrations Martin and David will take you through a brief history of passwords, discussing password lengths and formats, password policies, guidelines and best practices, the storage and transmission of passwords, 2FA and MFA, and pretty much everything you ever wanted to know about passwords. All in under an hour.\n\nThroughout the talk we will employ a Red vs Blue format with Martin playing Blue, discussing best practices and how to keep your logins protected. While David will be playing Red, discussing the techniques and tools employed by malicious actors in an attempt to secure access to your logins.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* All about Passwords\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes."

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism. Sam is currently the Program Lead at Digital Rights Watch, where they advocate for human rights in the digital age. Their areas of interest include the impacts of pervasive surveillance and privacy as a collective good.

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

        "description": "Title:\n\nZero Trust for API Security and Legal Risk Management\n\nDescription:\n\nWeb applications are prone to various cybersecurity risks. Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform.

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism. Sam is currently the Program Lead at Digital Rights Watch, where they advocate for human rights in the digital age. Their areas of interest include the impacts of pervasive surveillance and privacy as a collective good. Sam has experience working in privacy in government, the private sector, and now in civil society. She has previously served on the board of the Australian Privacy Foundation, and was the Program Director of Code Like a Girl while studying postgraduate data science."

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment.

My theory is that this is down to cloud security appearing to be so different to what people are used to working with. Let\u2019s try and bust that myth.\n\nJoin me for a bird\u2019s eye view of the most important security concepts on AWS, what the best practices are around them as well as what AWS can do to help make life easier. I hope that this talk makes some of you more comfortable exploring AWS in the future.\n\nAbout Alex:\n\nAlex Kearns is a consultant at Inawisdom in Ipswich delivering data and AI/ML solutions on AWS for a variety of customers. Prior to this he has worked for an early stage startup and BT in a security focused role. He has a firm belief that security best practices should underpin all workloads, especially those in public clouds such as AWS.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* Welcome and OWASP updates\n* Talk: The best practices of working securely on AWS\n* Q&A"

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

Both of these flagship OWASP projects work together to allow organizations to make better risk-based decisions.\n* 20:00 - 20:15 - **Break**\n* 20:15 - 21:00 - **Klaas Wijbrans:Software Bill of Material \u2013 why do we need it, what is it and how can we overcome the current challenges**\nThe Executive Order on Cybersecurity of the Biden administration caused a lot of activity on the \u2018software bill of material\u2019. This talk will go into the details why it is being asked, what it consists of, and the practical challenges the industry needs to solve to reliably and efficiently create and use it in an automated way.\n\n**Bio:**\n**Steve Springett** educates teams on the strategy and specifics of developing secure software. He practices security at every stage of the development lifecycle by leading sessions on threat modeling, secure architecture and design, static/dynamic/component analysis, offensive research, and defensive programming techniques. Steve's passionate about helping organizations identify and reduce risk from the use of third-party and open source components. He is an open source advocate and leads the OWASP Dependency-Track project, OWASP Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS), and is the Chair of the OWASP CycloneDX Core Working Group, a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) Standard.\n\n**Klaas Wijbrans** is fellow architect in the Chief Architect Office of Philips. He has thirty years of experience in complex, software intensive systems and products like traffic control systems, storm surge barrier control system, telecommunications equipment and medical systems.

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

While David will be playing Red, discussing the techniques and tools employed by malicious actors in an attempt to secure access to your logins.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* All about Passwords\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes."

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

        "description": "Hey OWASP Belfast!\nPlease join us at our event with Jeff Williams where we will be talking about security challenges and how to think inside the box.\n\nSoftware is incredibly hard to secure because it's a black box. We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

Welche Limitierungen hat ein DAST Scanner beim automatischen Scannen von Webanwendungen? Mit welchen Erwartungshaltungen m\u00fcssen wir bei unseren Nutzern umgehen? Wie funktioniert ein DAST Scanner im gro\u00dfen Ma\u00dfstab von technischer Seite? Ren\u00e9 Milzarek gibt in diesem Vortrag auch einen Blick hinter den \"Vorhang\" eines DAST Scanner Anbieters.\n\nShort-Bio:\nRen\u00e9 Milzarek studierte an der Technischen Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen (TUM) Informatik mit Schwerpunkt auf IT-Sicherheit. Nach seinem Abschluss gr\u00fcndete er 2017 mit Kommilitonen das Startup Crashtest Security welches einen DAST Scanner f\u00fcr moderne Webanwendungen anbietet. Als Gr\u00fcnder verantwortet er die gesamte Technologie des Services und entwickelt auch selbst am JavaScript Crawler.\n\nWeitere Themen im Stammtisch:\n\n* Freie Diskussion, bringt bitte Themen mit!\n* Wir suchen noch Vortr\u00e4ge f\u00fcr die kommenden Stammtische!\n\nDer M\u00fcnchner OWASP-Stammtisch ist ein regelm\u00e4\u00dfiges offenes Treffen, bei dem Austausch von Ideen und Erfahrungen mit Anwendungs- und Netzwerksicherheit im Vordergrund steht.\n\nAuf der Website findet Ihr mehr zum Stammtisch sowie eine \u00dcbersicht der vergangen Vortr\u00e4ge: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/muenchen"

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"

So what about start writing better software!\" by Jens Roed Andersen, Cybersecurity SME\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAccording to Marc Andreesen, the inventor of the worlds' first commercial web-browser, software is already eating the world. Post-corona we have experienced a digitization without precedence, but the exploding numbers on cybersecurity incidents have shown that resilience in our infrastructure as well as in our digital systems are not at all up to the task.\n\nAnd as software is the foundation for all these vulnerabilities, perhaps now is the time to start making better, more secure software. But the question is, how to do that, in an ever more agile world, where functionality often comes before security?\n\nAbout Jens:\nJens Roed Andersen has 25+ years of experience in information security, among them 10 years as the CISO of Arla Foods and Energinet.dk. He is literally the \"Swiss-army knife\" of cybersecurity, but in recent years he has started focusing more and more on the preconditions and fundamentals of good security. Hence, he has worked intensely in recent years with software security and securing the SDLC, where DevSecOps, CI/CD-pipelines/tooling and \"shift left\" has been on the agenda.\n\nSo come hear his experiences and views on what to do when it comes to improving our ability to produce better and more secure software in the modern digitized world. And maybe there will be some interesting and fun war-stories from a life in information security.\n\n21:15 - 21:30\nGoodbyes and plans going forward\nThomas Ljungberg Kristensen - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nDennis Perto - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus\nMikkel R\u00f8mer - Co-Chapter Leader OWASP Aarhus"

This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment.

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. By 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\nBio:\n\nDr Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC."

Hardly a week goes by without some form of privacy scandal: Cambridge Analytica, the Ashley Madison data breach, hell, even governments have been riddled with privacy disasters over recent years.\n\nSo how can you make sure that this doesn't happen to you? And, perhaps more importantly, how can you make sure that you are protecting your users from privacy-related harms?\n\nBuilding security into software is essential--you know this already. But what about privacy? This session explores how to think about building privacy into design from the start, to avoid a big ol' privacy mess later on. We'll do a 101 of privacy law, and talk through some tips to put privacy into practice. We'll also explore some bigger ideas about privacy and why it's so important \\*beyond\\* just making sure you're complying with the law and avoiding a reputational disaster.\n\nSAMANTHA FLOREANI\n\nSamantha Floreani (@samfloreani) works at the intersection of human rights, technology, and feminism.

We've spent decades struggling to verify properties of software from the *outside* by analyzing the source code, scanning, fuzzing, pentesting, etc.\nThe goal of \"security observability\" is to expose exactly what's going on *inside* the box while it's running. Analyzing a running application has speed, accuracy, coverage, and scalability advantages that change the way Dev, Sec, and Ops communicate and work together. In this talk, you'll learn how to use the free and open-source Java Observability Toolkit (JOT) project to easily create your own powerful \"inside out\" security tests without coding. You can use JOT to analyze security defenses, identify complex vulnerabilities, create custom sandboxes, and enforce policy at runtime. Ultimately, security observability enables DevSecOps to work together in harmony, so you can focus on delivering value at high velocity.\n\nJeff brings more than 20 years of security leadership experience as co-founder and Chief Technology Officer of Contrast Security. Previously, Jeff was co-founder and CEO of Aspect Security, a successful and innovative application security consulting company acquired by EY. Jeff is also a founder and major contributor to OWASP, where he served as Global Chairman for 10 years, and created the OWASP Top 10, OWASP Enterprise Security API, OWASP Application Security Verification Standard, XSS Prevention Cheat Sheet, and many more popular open-source projects. Jeff has a BA from Virginia, an MA from George Mason, and a JD from Georgetown."

This is done through mini-discussions, demos, presentations, and series of meetings to cover more involved topics (i.e. book topics). Generally the topics will be participant-led, meaning that attendees will volunteer their time to present or lead a discussion, whether a one-time presentation of a topic they wish to review or need help with, or walk through topics of a particular chapter of a book being covered. There will still be OWASP leadership involved with scheduling and such, but the idea is to get a better \u201chands-on\u201d approach to create a more productive learning environment. We learn more when we are involved.\n\nMore information: https://owasp.org/www-chapter-austin/studygroups.html"

This is a great time for an OWASP IL meetup to enrich your minds with top quality content.\nJoin us for an exciting event of the local chapter and enjoy mingling, presentations, many treats, and a piece of mind from your daily security hassles!\nThis event will be hosted at Enso's office in Tel Aviv, alongside treats, drinks and more!\n\nAgenda:\n\n 18:00 - 18:30 - gathering and food - We will gather at Enso Security Offices, 1st floor for drinks, great treats, mingling and COVID19 free zone!\n\n 18:30 - 18:45 - Keynote + Microphone tuning\n\n 18:45 to 19:15 - Going beyond the SBOM - an Application Stack BOM for modern WebApps\n\nOmer Yaron - Head of Research @ Enso Security\n\nThe common perception of software development maintains that the source code is the fundamental element of any application. However as modern applications grow more complex, researchers (like us!) are eager to dive deeper and gain a wider and more comprehensive view of their application stack. Since standard techniques generated a limited and fragmented picture, we set out on a new approach. The presentation will take listeners through an in-depth research process which led us to build a new infrastructure, something beyond the SBOM towards a comprehensive and full in scope bill of materials for the entire application stack-- the ASBOM.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - The Major CI/CD risks of 2022\n\nOmer Gil - Head of Research @ Cider Security\nDaniel Krivelevich - Co-Founder & CTO @ Cider Security\n\nAdversaries of all levels of sophistication are shifting their attention to CI/CD, realizing CI/CD services provide an efficient path to reaching an organization\u2019s crown jewels. The industry is witnessing a significant rise in the amount, frequency and magnitude of incidents and attack vectors focusing on abusing flaws in the CI/CD ecosystem, including Solarwinds, Codecov, The PHP hack, Dependency Confusion and many others.\nIn this talk we will review the results of our research covering some of today\u2019s most common CI/CD security risks, the technical nature of each risk, and the best practices around detecting and preventing these risks.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Hacking like in the old days\n\nGil Cohen - Research Director & Application Security SME @ CYE\nand Omri Inbar - Cyber Security Expert @ CYE\n\nRecent advanced technologies such as server side object-relational mapping (ORM) and client side JS frameworks, eliminate SQL injection and cross site scripting (XSS) attacks. Injections are no longer at the top of OWASP top 10 for the first time in years. Are these vulnerabilities still relevant in 2022?\nIn this lecture we will present some recent examples of the-good-old-days-vulnerabilities from the last 2 years, including advanced SQL injections and XSS, server side XSS, RCE & server side template injection as well as a case study of an advanced concatenation of 6 techniques to bypass a web application firewall.\n\nThis marvelous meetup will also be available virtually in Zoom"
