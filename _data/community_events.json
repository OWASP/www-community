Please reach out if the event gets packed, and I will add room for more people.\n\n**Agenda:**\n19:00 - 19:10 \u2013 \"Welcome\" by OWASP Chapter Aarhus\n19:10 - 19:55 \u2013 Liz Keogh \u2013 Value Streams are Made of People\n19:55 \u2013 20:05 \u2013 Short break\n20:05 \u2013 20:55 \u2013 Simon Bennetts \u2013 Introduction to ZAP\n**About Liz Keogh:**\nLiz Keogh is an influential developer and Agile Coach based in London. She is a well-known blogger and international speaker, a core member of the BDD community and a passionate advocate of the Cynefin framework and of Wardley Mapping.\nLiz has over 20 years\u2019 experience in delivering and coaching others to deliver software, from small start-ups to global enterprises. She enjoys coding, has written several automation libraries, and extensively contributed to the BDD framework, JBehave. She particularly loves helping people fulfill their potential, using transparency, positive language, well-formed outcomes and safe-to-fail experiments in making change innovative, easy and fun. She specializes in pragmatic Agile methods that build on existing personal and organizational strengths.\nThe rest of her time is spent gardening, gaming, making sourdough bread, and rebelling against the Climate Crisis.\n**About her presentation: Value Streams are Made of People**\nFor millenia, human beings have survived by learning, then applying our learning to different contexts. We\u2019re so good at it that we\u2019re driven to find those patterns, even when they don\u2019t exist. Our desire for the predictable suffuses everything we do!\n\nIn Lean Production, mapping value streams can help us find, and eliminate, sources of unpredictability. Software Development though is not like a factory, building the same thing over and over again. In this talk we look at how to embrace the unpredictability inherent to innovation, making value streams out of the people involved in them: not from the sum of their parts, but from the product of their relationships.\n**About Simon Bennetts:**\nSimon Bennetts is the Zed Attack Proxy (ZAP) Founder and Project Leader, and works full time on ZAP thanks to the Software Security Project.\n\nHe has talked about and demonstrated ZAP at conferences all over the world, including Blackhat, JavaOne, FOSDEM and OWASP AppSec EU, USA & AsiaPac.\n\nPrior to making the move into security he was a developer for 25 years and strongly believes that\nyou cannot build secure web applications without knowing how to attack them."

Including security controls in applications sometimes may be considered an overhead. However, if security controls are not added to applications during development, it may be challenging to add them later on. In this presentation, we will see how code can be written insecurely and really how simple it is to include the required security controls in the application.\n\nShruti is a cyber security / enterprise security architect with experience in ISO27001, PCI-DSS, policies, standards, security tools, threat modelling, risk assessments. Shruti works on security strategies and collaborates with cross-functional groups to implement information security controls in software development life-cycle, service operations, service delivery such that security controls support business requirements.\n\n**Ross Brown of the SWCRC (South West Cyber Resilience Centre)**\nI am a retired Detective officer who during my service carried out numerous roles, although primarily operating within mainstream Criminal investigations. As a trainer with Dorset Police I led a team who implemented training for a new force wide Records Management System as well as devising and writing the supervisors course. During a number of career breaks I have experience of running large scale engineering projects in the middle east.\n\nI joined the South West Cyber Resilience Centre as a Detective Inspector and head of cyber and innovation and served in that post until my retirement. I have subsequently taken on the same role as a member of Police staff.\n\nThe Cyber Resilience Centre for the South West supports and helps protect SMEs and supply chain businesses and third sector organisations in the region against cyber crime.\nWorking with local Universities and Police forces in the South West provides access to the latest local as well as national information on emerging cyber threats, criminal trends, best practice for cyber resilience and new technology to provide timely advice to prepare and protect business.\n\n**James Walsh**\nJames Walsh of Hays recruitment will be giving us an insight into the latest salary guide for the cyber security industry.\n\n**Dylan Collins**\n\"A system's biggest vulnerability is the user. With frequent software patches becoming more and more necessary to maintain security standards, does the urge to protect a system actually make people more exposed? Na\u00efve users jumping at sudden update prompts may be jumping through hoops for an attacker.\" - A research question from local software developer, Dylan Collins.\n\n**Event and Venue**\nWe will be joining Hays Recruitment in Bournemouth for this event, there is a limit on numbers, so signup is essential. Names will be required upon arrival to enter the building.\n\nThere will be food and drink provided for this event, so please let us know of any dietary requirements or allergies."

This talk delves into the sophisticated technologies behind the creation of these deceptive videos and images. We\u2019ll explore cutting-edge methods for detecting such manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of digital content. However, as detection techniques advance, so too do evasion strategies, including adversarial attacks and prompt injection methods. This poses the question: Can we still believe everything that we see?\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24**.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 29.11.2023 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"

In this presentation we highlight the risks of staying with the ancient (roughly 2019-2021) \u201ccurrent\u201d best practices. The current (circa 2022) BCPs bring many changes, such as deprecation of the implicit flow, required usage of PKCE and the BFF pattern which mitigates some of the previous attack vectors. It takes time for new concepts to fully mature and secure defaults emerge. While following the latest BCPs it\u2019s still possible to make mistakes and end up with a broken implementation. This presentation will show some common OAuth2/OIDC security pitfalls and why it is bad practice to use reverse proxy catch-all routing in your BFF, an OAuth2 client with access to many scopes, together with APIs that do authorization based on just a valid token and scopes. Does your BFF enable authenticated SSRF as a Service? During the presentation we will demonstrate both attacks and defences for a OAuth2/OIDC application running locally.\n**Pontus Hanssen** in an experienced security researcher and penetration tester. He loves to hack everything that blinks or has an IP address.

He specializes in implementing authentication flows and authorization for web applications and APIs that manage sensitive data. Tobias performs security reviews and penetration tests as part of Omegapoint Cybersecurity Gothenburg, a group of experts in application security. He also gives courses in application security and is an appreciated speaker in OAuth2 and OpenID Connect areas.\n\n**18:30 - 19:15:** Food\n\n**19:15 - 20:00:** *Pentesting War Stories*\nWorking in penetration testing generates quite a few interesting stories\nabout spectacular vulnerabilities found in tested systems.\nOften these stories are not shared outside of a small circle of people.\nThis presentation goes through a selection of vulnerabilities found\nduring assignments in the recent years. The titles of the stories are:\n\u201cThe omnipotent client cert\u201d (automotive app), \u201cNext level XSS\u201c (web),\nNo route to boat\u201d (network), and \u201dHaving a conversation with a door\nhandle\" (embedded).\n**Emilie Barse** is an experienced IT security consultant with a deep\ninterest in security testing and log analysis.

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

        "description": "**There is a dark side to productivity with open source. In modern applications, the majority of code on which an application is built isn\u2019t code written by your team. Modern applications are built on the backs of volunteer communities and open-source software. These volunteers and their software delivery practices all become potential attack vectors.**\n\n**The truth is that most organizations do not factor open-source supply chain attacks into their organization\u2019s threat models today. Security incidents such as the CodeCov bash uploader script, the npm colors, and faker intentionally introduced malicious commits, and the recent PyPi backdoors targeting AWS credentials highlight the impact of supply chain attacks as a scalable attack pattern. To spread awareness on supply chain attacks so that organizations can scalably handle them we propose baking supply chain attacks into existing threat modeling procedures and software development culture so that organizations can champion supply chain management of open source in the places where they are most impactful, at development time.**\n\n**We will present a comprehensive, comprehensible, and technology-agnostic taxonomy of attack vectors, created on the basis of hundreds of real-world incidents and validated by experts in the domain. Following, we will discuss the types of defenses you can put in place to detect and respond to such modern day attacks and how you can work these defenses in based on your program\u2019s maturity.**"

Using GitHub Copilot as a case study, he'll emphasize the importance of secure coding practices and manual code reviews in AI-driven development.\n\n**Talk 2 - Seeing is Not Always Believing: The Rise, Detection, and Evasion of Deepfakes**\n\n*Niklas Bunzel, PhD student at TU-Darmstadt and research scientist at Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) and the National Research Centre for Applied Cybersecurity - ATHENE*\n\n*Raphael Antonius Frick, research fellow at Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology (SIT) and the National Research Centre for Applied Cybersecurity - ATHENE*\n\nIn an era where digital information dominates, the saying \u201cseeing is believing\u201d has been cast into doubt with the emergence of deepfakes \u2014 AI-generated media that manipulates reality. This talk delves into the sophisticated technologies behind the creation of these deceptive videos and images. We\u2019ll explore cutting-edge methods for detecting such manipulations, ensuring the authenticity of digital content. However, as detection techniques advance, so too do evasion strategies, including adversarial attacks and prompt injection methods. This poses the question: Can we still believe everything that we see?\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks** kindly provided by **CHECK24**.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 29.11.2023 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us on **[Twitter #owasp_frankfurt](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)**[ ](https://twitter.com/owasp_frankfurt)and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you for this in-person event!"
