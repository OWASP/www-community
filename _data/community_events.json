However, traditional approaches (blocklisting, brute force, etc.) have proven ineffective and are, oftentimes, too late to prevent any real security issues.\nIn this session, we\u2019ll discuss some of the psychology behind why we\u2019re referred to as the \u201cdepartment of NO\u201d as well as how to start shifting that perception. You will also learn of some tactics to identify and mitigate shadow IT as well as proactive measures that may help avoid future sprawl."

Better Call Saul! - Daniel Davis\n7:15 - 8:00: Talk 3: Details to follow\n\n**Talk 1:**\nSpeaker:\nAnjum Ahuja\n\nTitle:\nAPI Security Blunders: Tales from the Cyber Trenches\n\nAbstract:\nIn this session, we dive into API Security by dissecting real-world blunders that have caused security breaches. We'll guide you through the process of identifying these anti-patterns and provide insights to effectively defend against such attacks.\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nAnjum is the Director of Security Research at Traceable.ai. He has worked on different aspects of security engineering specifically Detection engineering & Incident response, AppSec and Threat Intelligence. He has presented at conferences like BSidesSF, BSidesCharm, and has multiple patents issued for IOT Security.\n\n**Talk 2:**\nSpeaker: Daniel Davis\n\nTitle: Had a Cyber Incident? Better Call Saul!\n\nAbstract: If you\u2019re a CISO, you\u2019re already calling your lawyer. The rest of you are going - huh??? From the SEC\u2019s legal action against Solarwinds to the looming specters of CMMC 2.0 and CIRCIA, when will cybersecurity\u2019s transformation into a legal domain be complete?\n\nSpeaker Bio:\nNo, Daniel isn\u2019t a lawyer, but he did stay at a Holiday Inn Express last night (does that one still hold up???). Cybersecurity isn\u2019t the first technical discipline to be \u201clegal-lite\u201d as he learned running safety programs for military aerospace programs. When things go wrong, people will always want to know who \u201csigned off on it\u201d.\nThis experience led Daniel to Lyft\u2019s autonomous vehicle division to create a public-private partnership to develop a framework for safety and cybersecurity for AVs. Today, he\u2019s the founder of Mindpipe, which will be open sourcing a next generation, end-to-end RAG pipeline leveraging open knowledge graph frameworks."

We\u2019re eager to share with the community a practical and innovative approach that worked for us: How we were able to move away from manually reviewing every feature developed while increasing the thoroughness of our security oversight. We\u2019ll explain how we succeeded at integrating generative AI tools using GitHub actions to automate the code review process and broaden security oversight in a highly efficient way. Attendees will learn from our journey and discover how they, too, can automate routine security checks, engaging human experts only when their expertise is truly needed.\n 19:20 to 19:30 - Beer Break\n 19:30 to 20:15 - Pains and advantages of application anomaly detection in containerized applications\n*Ben Hirschberg - CTO @ ARMO*\nIn this talk an open-source based application anomaly detection system to detect malicious activity. The solution focuses on applications running in Kubernetes orchestration system.\nIn the talk I will cover these points:\n\\* Main attack vectors to these kinds of applications: exploit remote vulnerabilities, supply-chain attacks\n\\* Anomaly detection dimensions: process, file, network and system-call activity\n\\* What detection dimension is working (or not working) with what kind of applications\n\\* What anomalies are bound to what kind of attacks\n\\* Live demo with the Kubescape project to show results\n\n 20:15 to 21:00 - The Dark Side of AI: The Hidden Risks in Open-Source AI Models\n*Jossef Harush Kadouri - Security Researcher @ Checkmarx*\nThis talk is for anyone who is using open source in their daily routine. The purpose is to bring awareness to the risks of software supply chain attackers lurking in some of our open-source code and to show how ridiculously easy it is for them to launch attacks.\nJoin me as we unravel the construction of AI models, focusing on their weak spots. Through multiple demos, witness how AI models can be manipulated to become malicious.\n\n====================================================================\nThis event is hosted by Axonius in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

Learn why every SCA tool is wrong, and how to deal with it.**\nJoin us for great networking, dinner and drinks, and see a presentation by **Darren Meyer**, Lead Solution Architect at Endor Labs.\n\n**ABSTRACT**: With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\n**Thanks to our Sponsor**: *[Endor Labs](https://www.endorlabs.com/)*\n*Endor Labs\u2019 Dependency Lifecycle Management Platform is designed to address the weakest link in software supply chain security: the ungoverned sprawl of open source software in the enterprise. Endor Labs\u2019 mission is to help developers spend less time dealing with security issues and more time accelerating development through safe code reuse. With this solution, development and security teams are able to maximize software reuse by safely evaluating, maintaining, and updating dependencies at scale.*\n\n**Thanks to our Host**: *[HiveWatch](https://www.hivewatch.com/)*\n*Intelligent, efficient, and scalable security*\n*HiveWatch is a cloud-based SaaS platform built for physical security teams to enhance their current security technologies. It streamlines incident response, allows for the consolidation of disparate programs and systems, and reduces false alarms.*\n\n**SPONSORSHIP Opportunities Available**\n*Vendors interested in sponsoring please send an email to sponsorship.la@owasp.org*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone. Please reach out to one of our chapter leaders if you have any feedback/concerns or would like to speak to us, we take these matters very seriously.

Our sincere apologies for the silence these past few months; it's been a rough time, in many ways. The landscape and conditions for meetups have changed, especially in the last year, thus, we must adapt to carry-on.\n\nSo, what's happening?\nThe TLDR: We'd meet at 6pm on a Wednesday monthly (except Dec/Jan), at a (different) food place each meetup. Hangout, and together contribute and decide on the AppSec topics we'd want to discuss, while we all grab a bite to eat (at own cost). All these finishing up by 7pm.\n\nFor RSVPs, please do try to keep it updated so that whomever that arrives first at the food place, can try to grab a table/seats for us. We'd be trying to just walk-in and grabbing a table.\n\nPlease see this Google Form for the details, and a quick poll on which Wednesday y'all prefer: [https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8](https://forms.gle/U3ArrazUpt9R5EGH8)\nWe'll close this poll by the 21st June 2024.\n\nWe've picked the first event's date and location, to get the ball rolling.\nSee you there.\nThank you."

Despite what I thought I knew, the reality was far more intricate.\n\nModern software development is a sprawling network of open-source dependencies, sophisticated build tools, plugins, pipelines, and runtimes. These components are fundamental in securing critical sectors of our daily lives\u2014finance, healthcare, infrastructure, transportation, and social interactions. However, this supply chain is under relentless attack and many of the potential threats are poorly understood.\n\nThis talk will delve into specific vulnerabilities, such as dependency poisoning and pipeline compromises, that exemplify the challenges we face. We\u2019ll explore strategies to mitigate these threats and discuss practical takeaways that attendees can immediately implement in their software development practices. Expect to leave with a deeper understanding of supply chain security and with ideas to fortify your software factory against these escalating threats.\n\n*Bio:*\nDavid Archer is a Solution Architect at Endor Labs. He began his career as a software developer and witnessed significant shifts in how software is built over the last two decades. After spells as a development lead, product director and pre-sales consultancy roles David consistently saw a concerning trend: security often took a backseat amidst the hustle and bustle of development priorities.\n\nSeeking to help address this balance David took an opportunity in 2018 to work full-time in the field of application security with a particular focus on technologies that promise to enhance security without impeding development speed. Through his extensive experience with secure coding practises and hands-on experience with the myriad of code analysis tools like IAST, SAST, DAST, RASP and SCA, he gained valuable insights into their relevance and effectiveness in a modern software factory.\n\n**Technical leverage: dependencies are a mixed blessing**\n*Abstract:*\nModern applications are build upon a large supply chain of (possibly open source) libraries and tools. In finance, leverage is the ratio of debts (other people\u2019s money) vs equity (your money) and the Lehman Brothers have made that concept famous. For software, technical leverage is the ratio between other people\u2019s code and your own code. I will argue with some examples from the Maven, Python and the NPM ecosystems that this is both a risk and an opportunity. The Lehmans Brothers were 30 to 1, what about the Software Sisters?\n\n*Bio:*\nFabio Massacci is a co-author of CVSS v4. Among other things, he is also a professor at Vrije Universiteit. He has been a speaker at hackers\u2019 venues (BlackHat USA, Asia) scientific security conferences (IEEE S&P, CCS), software engineering (ICSE,MSR) and risk analysis (SRA). He coordinates the EU project Sec4AI4Sec (name tells it all) and an NWO project on using AI for security threat intelligence. While almost all professors are sellers of tech (through their papers or their spin-offs) he was also for 7 years deputy for ICT procurements and services supervising a 70+ workforce and few millions Euro in outsourcing contracts. Being a buyer of tech makes a difference in perspective."

Reuters reports that the popular chatbot reached 100 million users in just two months after its launch. The app had 13 million daily unique visitors making it the fastest-growing consumer app in history.\n\nChatGPT uses Large Language Models and produces excellent content in the form of answers to the questions users may ask of it. However, the weakness lies in validating the truth in the training data. Where was the training data sourced from? If there are no guardrails on training data, bad data, incorrect facts and artifacts can make its way into the models. This can quickly spiral out of control as the AI then continuously learns from its echo chamber of misinformation. And yet the responses it returns will sound highly confident - the \u201challucination\u201d effect which is the true danger for recipients of the misinformation. There has been misinformation on the web for decades - the key difference here is in the conversational response misleading the recipient to believe the answer is from a true human expert."

Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.\n2. **OWASP Top 10 for LLM Applications: A Detailed Review**\n\n**Abstract:**\nAs the adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) in corporate and governmental organizations becomes increasingly common, it introduces unique security challenges that need immediate and effective management. This presentation provides a detailed overview of the OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications, which in less than eight months has already become a trusted resource on how to secure LLMs within and outside of the global cybersecurity community. The goal of the publication is to equip organizations with the knowledge to successfully navigate LLM security challenges. Beginning with a technical primer on AI, Machine Learning, and LLMs, the presentation will ensure a foundational understanding of the technology and its potential security risks. We will then review critical vulnerabilities such as Prompt Injection, Insecure Output Handling, Training Data Poisoning, Model Denial of Service, and Supply Chain Vulnerabilities, among others, and highlight the importance of recognizing and mitigating these risks as well as provide actionable advice for secure LLM implementation. Through this presentation, the audience will learn how to safeguard their LLM deployments against emerging threats, ensuring both the security and efficacy of these powerful AI tools in their organizational context.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Simon Sulyma** is an expert in the fields of cybersecurity and information risk, with close to 20 years of experience designing, building, securing, and auditing complex IT systems at large financial institutions across Canada. Simon currently leads the Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) function at the Global Wealth and Asset Management segment at Manulife. He frequently speaks at conferences, trainings, and meetups, organizes and participates in community events, and mentors people entering the cybersecurity field. Simon holds a Master's degree in Information Security and a number of certifications including CISA, CISSP, CISM, CRISC, CCSP, and AZ-500.\n\n**Diana Rogachova** is a Data Science and Machine Learning professional. In 2023, she graduated from a bootcamp where she subsequently worked as a Teaching Assistant for Data Science students. Her areas of interest are the intersection of Generative AI, cybersecurity, and privacy as well as the ethical use of AI. Diana holds the Machine Learning certification from Amazon Web Services (AWS) and is currently pursuing the Cybersecurity Certificate from ISC2. She also has a Bachelor\u2019s Degree in Criminology and Criminal Justice from Carleton University and three years of experience in the criminal justice field."

It is certainly seen as some mystical black box that should not be touched. The lack of access to Mainframes such as the IBM zSeries often does not make it easy to conduct research on these systems that process billions of transactions per year and hold sensitive data.\nDuring this talk we will give an insight into the history of Mainframes, some of their weaknesses (and strengths) and demonstrate some of the tools and exploitation techniques that can be used to assess, gain a foothold, and escalate privileges to SPECIAL. Finally, we will provide information on where to start learning about Mainframes with special attention paid to tapping into the free resources and emulators that exist out there.\n\n**About us**\nKev Milne is a technical specialist with 30 years of experience, and over 20 years of Cyber Security experience having started Pen Testing first in 1999. He is currently the Training and Infrastructure Manager for Security Testing in the Finance Industry. His job is to mentor, and motivate the next generation of testers whilst maintaining the Security Testing Labs.\nHubert Januszewski is a graduate of Abertay University Ethical Hacking course and is currently part an Offensive Security Testing Team in the Finance Industry where he conducts tests on everything from Infrastructure, Web Applications, Cloud and Mainframes! Hubert's interests include CTFs, Sci-fi books, games, and technology."
