Among these, wind power has surged to the forefront, harnessing the natural force of wind to generate clean and efficient electricity. As we embrace the transition towards greener energy solutions, it is imperative that we also confront the challenges that accompany it. One such challenge, though perhaps less visible, is cybersecurity.\nThroughout this presentation, we will delve into the intricacies of cybersecurity as it pertains to wind power plants. We will explore the broader business context, provide overview of customer expectations and the increasingly stringent requirements imposed by national legislators. Additionally, we will sketch the threats and vulnerabilities facing these critical assets. Finally, we will provide an overview of the strategies and technologies deployed to mitigate these risks, ensuring the resilience and safety of our wind power infrastructure amidst the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats.\n\n**20:00 \u2013 20:30** Networking break\n\n**20:30 \u2013 21:25** Aleksander Kj\u00e6r vil give en grundl\u00e6ggende introduktion til forhandling baseret p\u00e5 Harvard Negotiations Project og Uri & Fishers bog \"Getting to Yes\".\n\nHan vil introducere n\u00f8glekoncepterne og teknikkerne inden for forhandling og vise, hvordan deltagerne selv kan anvende disse til at forbedre deres forhandlingsevner - b\u00e5de professionelt og personligt. Det er hans holdning, at alle kan blive en dygtig forhandler!\nDerudover vil han illustrere disse teknikker med konkrete eksempler fra virkelige forhandlingssituationer.\n\nHan vil ogs\u00e5 pr\u00e6sentere, hvordan man kan overbevise en tv\u00e6r og n\u00e6rrig ledelse om at investere mere i IT-sikkerhed ved hj\u00e6lp af de forhandlingsteknikker, der har gennemg\u00e5et.\n\nKort om Aleksander - Jeg har en kandidatgrad i \u00f8konomi og antropologi og har altid haft stor interesse for forhandling gennem mine studier, is\u00e6r i en international kontekst. Bl.a. var jeg i praktik p\u00e5 den danske ambassade i Tallinn Estland i 2018, hvor der skete en masse inden for det milit\u00e6re og cyber- og informationssikkerhed omr\u00e5det i Danmark og Estland. Efterf\u00f8lgende tilbragte jeg fire m\u00e5neder i New York City, hvor jeg skrev mit speciale om danske virksomheders udfordringer med at etablere sig p\u00e5 det amerikanske marked. P\u00e5 nuv\u00e6rende tidspunkt studerer jeg softwareteknologi p\u00e5 6. semester og er s\u00e6rligt interesseret i governance-omr\u00e5det inden cyber- og informationssikkerhed, som jeg h\u00e5ber at g\u00f8re en karriere indenfor i fremtiden.\n\n**21:15 \u2013 21:30** Closing notes, networking and goodbyes"

Join us as we discuss vulnerabilities identified in [points.com](http://points.com/) and other pieces of airline infrastructure which lead to mass PII disclosure, an infinite money glitch, and free upgrades.\n\n**Talk #2 -** Secrets from a bygone era by **Dylan Ayrey**\nGitHub is a platform that was designed for sharing, it wasn't designed for unsharing. So how difficult does it become to unshare? This talk will dig into all the different ways your secrets might get replicated, propagated, persisted, and shared, for decades following your mistake.\n\n**Talk#3** The Internet is broken, Putting IPv6 into perspective\n**Description**:\nMost of the Internet is currently running on a legacy version of the Internet Protocol: IPv4. Despite of this, the number of engineers, especially in security, who know how to use IPv6 is relatively low. In this talk, previously presented internally at NCC Group, I will show you why today's Internet does not live up to its original vision, take you back to the past to show you what the IPv4 Internet used to look like and through this reveal the secrets that will make you understand IPv6.\n\n**Speaker**:**Denis Smajlovi\u0107,** Founding Security Consultant at Nova Information Security.

Networking with your peers starts at 5:00 - food is served at 5:30 and the presentation starts at 6:00.\n\n**Presentation:** AppSec 2.0: Reimagine AppSec With Runtime Analysis\n\n**Abstract:** SCA tools (container and dependency scans) generate too much noise. Runtime security tools don\u2019t understand SCA findings, and don\u2019t come in until production. What if you could marry SCA with runtime analysis during dev, test, and prod?\n\nIn this session, Kiran Kamity, CEO and Founder of Deepfactor, will discuss how the next generation of AppSec needs to go beyond just integrating static SCA into your CI pipeline, to analyzing insecure behaviors inside running apps and correlating that back to SCA to understand which vulnerable components are actually loaded into memory and used by your application. This new approach to AppSec will detect both known vulnerabilities/CVEs with SCA scans and unknown vulnerabilities with runtime reachability analysis. It will then prioritize known vulnerabilities with runtime correlation of SCA findings. End result: you catch most of the key risks in your app, prioritize the key items your devs need to work on without flooding them with alerts, and remove unused components from your containers to burn down your CVE debt rapidly\u2026.and achieve the true mission of AppSec\u2026to empower engineering and security teams to create secure applications"

In this presentation, we aim to provide attendees with a new perspective and tools for evaluating the trustworthiness of open source code before using it in their own projects. This talk is for anyone who uses open source in their daily work. The goal is to raise awareness about the risks of software supply chain attackers hiding in open source code, and to demonstrate how easy it is for attackers to launch attacks. Attendees will learn about tools for detecting when they are being tricked and how to stay alert to potential threats.\n\n**\"SBOMS and why they can help make your software more secure\" - Anthony Harrison**\n\nWith a growing interest (or maybe it is just awareness) in Software Bill of Material (SBOM) raised by various initiatives from governments (US, EU and now the UK with the recently announced consultation on software security and resilience), SBOMs are starting (in certain markets) to form part of the development landscape. As software systems become increasingly complex relying on an extensive (and often unknown) software supply chain, it is essential to have a full understanding of all of the components which are used in a solution. This applies at all stages of the life cycle and an SBOM is considered to be a key artefact in providing the necessary information to support a vulnerability management process. This talk will explain what a SBOM is, how and when they should be produced (and some of the challenges that need to be overcome) and demonstrate how they should form part of a DevSecOPs lifecycle. I will try and supplement the talk with some demonstrations using a number of open source applications.\n\n**\"Decoding Software Composition Analysis (SCA): Unveiling Pain Points in SCA\" - Kaiwen Jiang**\n\nAn overview of Software Composition Analysis (SCA) and its significance in bolstering software security. It includes discussions on SCA tools and key steps for implementation, and addresses challenges associated with SCA adoption.\n\n**SPEAKERS**\n\n**Tal Folkman**\nTal Folkman is a security research team lead and accomplished expert in cybersecurity with over 8 years of experience in the field. Tal possesses exceptional skills in detecting and analyzing malicious code present in open-source software supply chains. In 2021, Tal joined Dustico, a software supply chain security startup that was later acquired by Checkmarx. Prior to this, she served for 5 years as both member and leader of IDF's Cybersecurity Red Team. Currently, Tal and her team are dedicated to identifying and combating software supply chain attackers, thereby ensuring the safety and security of the ecosystem.\n\n**Anthony Harrison**\nAnthony is an independent systems/software/cyber consultant. Anthony is a member of the OpenSSF SBOM Everywhere working group and SBOM Forum. Anthony has presented on SBOMs at FOSDEM (2002 and 2023), EuroPython 2022 and at PyCascades (Vancouver). In his spare time Anthony teaches Python at Manchester CoderDojo and has acts as a mentor for Google Summer of Code (GSOC) projects supported by the Python Software Foundation\n\n**Kaiwen Jiang**\nKaiwen Jiang is an Application Security Engineer at Wise, with expertise in threat modeling, secure code scanning, and bug bounty initiatives.

However, with great power comes great responsibility, and API security is more critical than ever.\n\nIn this session, we will discuss the OWASP API Security Top 10, a comprehensive guide to the most critical API security risks which was first released in 2019 and updated in 2023. We will then dive into real-world examples of API security issues found on well-known solutions powered by APIs, providing a detailed analysis of the vulnerabilities and the impact they could have had on the affected organizations.\n\nBy the end of this session, you will have a better understanding of the importance of API security and the steps you can take to protect your organization\u2019s APIs from attacks.\n\n*Bio:*\nErez Yalon is the VP of Security Research at Checkmarx. Yalon oversees Checkmarx\u2019s research team comprising analysts, pen testers, security engineers, and bug bounty hunters. He brings vast experience to his position and his efforts to empower today\u2019s developers and organizations to deliver more secure applications. Yalon is the Founder of the DEF CON AppSec Village and co-leads the OWASP API Security Project. Over the years, Yalon has been invited to speak at prominent events, including RSAC, Black Hat, DEF CON, and OWASP\u2019s global conferences, and featured in news outlets such as Fortune, Forbes, Wired, TechCrunch, and Dark Reading.\nPaulo Silva is a security practitioner with a solid background in software development, who has spent the last decade focused on identifying critical vulnerabilities and breaking software. Paulo is a long-time OWASP volunteer and co-leader of the OWASP API Security Project, where he advocates for secure API practices and contributes significantly to mitigating security risks in the API landscape.\n\n**OWASP Security Champions Guide - Updates:**\nOWASP Security Champions Guide project team will provide updates on the release of the next OWASP Security Champions Guide!\n\n**How (not) to use secrets with OWASP WrongSecrets**\n*Abstract:*\nIf you want to bring an app to production, you need to know where to put your secrets and how to access them safely. In this session, we\u2019ll go into how to *not* use secrets with a purposefully vulnerable application. We hope you\u2019ll take this knowledge and not make the same mistakes in your own app. Of course, you\u2019ll also learn a thing or two on how to do secrets management properly. Alternatively, you can use this app to teach others!\n\n*Bio:*\nI am a Freelance Security Consultant and engineer, and co-project lead of OWASP WrongSecrets. My specialties are security in application development/SRE and cloud. Outside of regular work, I like to spend time creating cool (and secure) apps."

Introduction to LLMs - Overview of Generative AI and potential Use Cases\n2. LLM Risk - Risks associated with LLM and how they differ from other types of AI\n3. AI Risk management and ML Ops - Core capabilities that support the management of AI and Generative AI risks\n\n#### Talk 2 \u2013 The iSOON Leak: What Is It and How to Analyse It\n\nSpeaker: Jim Slaughter\n\nIn late February, an unusual event occurred. While it was widely known the PRC was actively engaged in espionage around the world, glimpses into how this was done were few and far between. Then a repo appeared on GitHub.\nThe iSOON leak has revealed a significant amount of information about the internal operations and capabilities of a state-affiliated hacking contractor in China. Given the challenges of analysing a large trove of files (often without the aid of a native language speaker), new ways of utilizing technology (including AI) were needed to fully understand this dataset.\n\nBio:\nWho Am I?

        "description": "TALK\n\nAvoid Becoming a Headline: A General Approach on AI Security\n\nSummary:\n\nThough AI/ML is a relatively ancient field of study (in computer science timekeeping years), so much hype, rightfully, has been generated with \u201ctoday\u2019s\u201d significant advancements. Unsurprising to security practitioners, perhaps, is the security implications that follow an explosive cycle of implementation. Companies are implementing fast and new security concerns are arising daily, before their traditional security teams can even answer the question \u201cWhat is AI/ML?\u201d\n\nPresenter:\n\nDavid Benas\n\nDavid Benas, AI Security practice lead within Synopsys, will leverage Synopsys Consulting\u2019s broad experience with many large clients and industry partners to present an introduction on AIML security; including an overview of the current implementation & threat landscape, the risks and challenges you should be aware of, and share some (hopefully very fun, or perhaps scary, depending on where you are in the process) anecdotes along the way."

However, evaluating the effectiveness of individual detections is often overlooked. In this presentation, we will delve into objective methods for assessing the quality of static analysis detections without incurring additional resources. We\u2019ll learn about how Microsoft\u2019s M365 Application Security team develops new detections and how they evaluate the effectiveness of those detections to ensure maximum impact at reducing security risk.\n\n**David Streat** is an experienced application security professional with almost 20 years in software development and application security. Having led Appsec teams at both EA and Microsoft, David has always strived to create solutions that improve code security where developers work. Plus, telling corny dad jokes doesn\u2019t hurt either."

        "description": "Hello everyone, we're excited to invite you to our OWASP Chapter meeting #65! Our Chapter serves central Germany, particularly within the Rhine-Main (Hesse) region, as a platform to discuss and share information and application security topics. Anyone who is interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member.\n\nThere will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n**1\\. Talk:** **Data Centricity for Cloud and Application Security**\n\n*Prof. Dr. Igor Podebrad, Director CISO Office, Google Cloud*\n\nIgor's talk will demystify data-centricity as a key driver for robust application and cloud security. He'll contrast the shift to data-centricity focus how it underpins cloud, AI and supports sound risk decisions. He will also discuss how this shift is reshaping security and resilience in for digital transformation. Igor is currently a Director at Google Cloud's Office of the CISO and a former Group CISO at Commerzbank AG. He holds a PhD in Medical Care Logistics from the University of Berlin.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Securing GenAI Applications on Cloud: Three pronged approach**\n\n*Hari Hayagreevan - Senior Cloud Security Architect, IBM*\n\nThe convergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (Gen AI) with cybersecurity introduces a spectrum of challenges and prospects. To embrace Gen AI extensively within enterprise contexts, it's imperative for these AI systems to be devoid of vulnerabilities in their application and infrastructure. This necessitates a holistic approach to securing Gen AI platforms. In this session, Hari will take you through the different viewpoints, offering insights from an Enterprise Security Architect\u2019s perspective, with practical enterprise scenarios. Hari is Enterprise Security Architect and currently is the Technical Leader for IBM Consulting\u2019s GenAI Security practice in DACH. He started his career as Cybersecurity incident responder (SOC Analyst) 18 years ago and now advises Enterprise CISOs and Security Architecture teams on adopting security principles for preventing cyber attacks.\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks**. For everyone who's interested, we will continue socializing at the Bockenheimer Weinkontor afterward.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 24.04.2024 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\ncodecentric AG, Lise-Meitner-Stra\u00dfe 4, 60486 Frankfurt am Main\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us here and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information, including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you at our event!"
