        "description": "OWASP Aarhus og DEIF holder vores n\u00e6ste meetup tirsdag d. 26. september i Aalborg fra 19.00 - 21:30.\n\nVi vil meget gerne, hvis I hj\u00e6lper hinanden ved at arrangere f\u00e6llesk\u00f8rsel. Skriv meget gerne her!\n\nDetaljerne er ikke helt p\u00e5 plads, men Jens Myrup Pedersen kommer og fort\u00e6ller om hans erfaring med Cyberlandsholdet og Robert Nedergaard Nielsen fort\u00e6ller om Haaukins-platformen.\n\nOm Jens:\n\nJens Myrup Pedersen er professor p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet, hvor han prim\u00e6rt forsker i netv\u00e6rkssikkerhed og tidlig detektion af skadelig aktivitet, og hvor han er ansvarlig for kandidatuddannelsen i Cybersikkerhed. Jens er ogs\u00e5 involveret i en r\u00e6kke projekter der skal \u00f8ge viden om og interesse for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, herunder Cyberskills - og s\u00e5 har han siden 2021 v\u00e6ret landstr\u00e6ner for Cyberlandsholdet.\n\nTitel: Cyberlandsholdet For The Win\n\nKort beskrivelse:\n\nKom med p\u00e5 rejsen bag Det Danske Cyberlandshold, der i 2022 - som det mindste land nogensinde - vandt de Europ\u00e6iske Mesterskaber i t\u00e6t konkurrence med store lande som Tyskland og Frankrig. Hvert \u00e5r dyster hundredevis af unge danskere om en plads p\u00e5 Cyberlandsholdet. En konkurrence, der starter med \u00e5bne online tr\u00e6nings-sessions der er tilg\u00e6ngelige for alle og ingen s\u00e6rlige foruds\u00e6tninger kr\u00e6ver, og som g\u00e5r gennem Kvalifikationsrunde, Regionale Mesterskaber og Nationale Mesterskaber til den eftertragtede Bootcamp med kun 25 pladser, hvoraf 10 ender p\u00e5 landsholdet. Men det er ikke kun en konkurrence: Det er ogs\u00e5 et vigtigt projekt for at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og derfor er det s\u00e5 vigtigt ogs\u00e5 at skabe noget fedt for det store flertal der ikke kommer p\u00e5 Landsholdet. \u201cCyberlandsholdet For The Win\u201d handler om landsholdets sejr, om arbejdet med at \u00f8ge interessen for cybersikkerhed blandt unge, og om hvorfor de to dele h\u00e6nger s\u00e5 t\u00e6t sammen.\n\n\\- Robert Nedergaard Nielsen er videnskabelig assistent p\u00e5 Aalborg Universitet\\, hvor han spiller en hovedrolle i projekter som Cyberskills og De Danske Cybermesterskaber\\. Han har mere end 5 \u00e5rs erfaring med udvikling\\, drift og anvendelse af tr\u00e6ningsplatformen Haaukins\\, der kombinerer CTF\\-formatet med l\u00e6ring og tr\u00e6ning\\.\n\n\\- Robert vil pr\u00e6sentere Haaukins\\-platformen\\, og de valg der ligger bag i forhold til at skabe en platform\\, der er egnet til \u201cbegyndere\u201d indenfor cybersikkerhed \\- herunder de mange IT\\-professionelle\\, der gerne skal opn\u00e5 en grundl\u00e6ggende viden om sikkerhed uden n\u00f8dvendigvis at blive eksperter\\. Deltagerne f\u00e5r ogs\u00e5 mulighed for selv at arbejde med p\u00e5 nogle af opgaverne\\, der indg\u00e5r som eksempler i opl\u00e6gget\\."

The Meet up will be in partnership with ESO, who have also kindly offered to host the evening and provide pizza, beers, and soft drinks for everyone.\n\n**Date: 28th September 2023**\n\n**Time: 6.00 PM**\n\n**Location: ESO, 42 Fountain St, Belfast BT1 5EF.**\n\n**Zoom Link:** [https://eso.zoom.us/j/95951081970?from=addon](https://eso.zoom.us/j/95951081970?from=addon)\n\nFirst, we will share an example of how identifying and assessing an attack on an application was used to gain insights into attacker behavior, and how invaluable this can prove in informing future actionable steps to prevent exposure. Next, we will present an overview of the key vulnerabilities associated with the use of social media in business and how easy it is to experience a breach when you do not have the correct policies and procedures in place. We will then delve into the world of ethical hacking, exploring the most common \"low-hanging fruit\" issues encountered over the past year. We will focus on prevalent vulnerabilities like HTML injection, Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR), and authentication flaws. Finally, we will finish with a technical talk from Ciaran from Rapid 7 who will take you through software supply chain software issues \u2013 malicious attackers, unsuitable licenses, and deprecated code which can all lead to problems in stuff that used to \"just work\". He will talk about how (despite what sales teams might tell you) there\u2019s no single simple solution to this and show you how to manage your risk in an achievable way.\n\n**Agenda:**\n\n6.00 - 6.20 Networking & Food\n\n6.20 - 6.30 Welcome to ESO Finian / Sarah\n\n6:40 - 7:00 Talk 1: \"The Safety Law of An Idiot Next to You\" by Tanya Vacarda\n\n7:00\u2013 7:20 Talk 2: \"From Likes to Leaks: Understanding the Security Risks of Social Media\" by Anne-Marie O'Donnell\n\n7:20 \u2013 7:30 BREAK (10 min)\n\n7:30 \u2013 7:50 Talk 3: \"Hacking For Devs: Bridging the Gap Between Developers and Hackers\" by Jacob Steadman\n\n7:50 \u2013 8:10 Talk 4 \"A Pragmatic Approach to Software Supply Chain Security\" by Ciaran Conliffe\n\n8.10 - 8.30 Networking and Exit\n\n**Disclaimer**\n\nAs always, our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes.\n\nOWASP, the Open Web Application Security Project, is an open community dedicated to enabling organizations to conceive, develop, acquire, operate, and maintain applications that can be trusted. So come along to Belfast chapter meetings if you would like to hear about, or share information with the community on how to ethically hack your own systems, how to defend your applications, and how to build security into your applications. Chapter meetings also provide a great opportunity to meet like-minded people with similar interests for general discussion, chit-chat, and banter!\n\n**Speaker Info:**\n\nTanya Vacarda - Allstate NI, Sr. Consultant [https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyavacarda/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tanyavacarda/)\n\nJacob Steadman- Vertical Structure Ltd, Ethical Hacker/Lead Penetration Tester [https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-steadman-08b17395/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jacob-steadman-08b17395/)\n\nAnne-Marie O'Donnell, BH Consulting Ltd, Cybersecurity Consultant [https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-marie-o-donnell-71536411a/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anne-marie-o-donnell-71536411a/)\n\nCiaran Conliffe, Security Architect, Rapid7 [https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaran-conliffe-7133843a/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ciaran-conliffe-7133843a/)\n\n**Additional Information**\n\nESO is located between Waterstones bookshop and the back of Boots in Belfast city center.

Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organisations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\n**The Cyber Security and Networking (CSN) Research Group** at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, CIISec & the Cyber East Cluster amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment.\n\n**Abstract : Adding SAST to CI/CD, Without Losing Any Friends**\n\nEveryone wants to put tests into the release pipeline, but no one wants to wait hours for them to finish. In this learning lab we will discuss multiple options for adding static application security testing (SAST) to your CI/CD, in ways that won\u2019t compromise speed or results, such as learning which results can be safely ignored, writing your own rules, company-specific checks, scanning PRs instead of commits, splitting blocking scans versus deep audit scans, etc. We will also cover ways to continuously find vulnerabilities.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n16:45 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:00 - Start of Presentation\n17:50 \u2013 Questions & Answers"

Ich berichte von den Antworten, die wir auf unsere Benachrichtigungen bekamen - von Geschenken \u00fcber Misstrauen bis hin zu Verschw\u00f6rungstheorien. Und ich berichte \u00fcber die Ergebnisse der Studien: Was hat funktioniert, und was nicht?

You grab your cup of coffee and get into your chair. You begin the day with some small cheese factory in Wisconsin claiming that they've been hacked. As you log in, you behold default creds, no MFA, and a small Cisco firewall set to ALLOW ANY:ANY because hey, having a rule means passing compliance checks. In the corner of your eye, you suddenly start to see alerts appear. Mimikatz, Metasploit, some Cobalt Strike Beacons, LSASS dumps, the lot quickly piles on and on in your environment. No amount of caffeinated adrenaline will help as you watch your environment go up in flames.\nEven the most seasoned veterans can be stricken by keyboard fright when facing the unknown state of a compromised system. Maybe your playbooks are woefully inadequate, out of date, or simply don't exist. Perhaps you've assumed that your tooling will feed you information, but the right information may not always be available or easily consumable. It can be daunting when faced with the prospect of manual box-by-box triage.\nIf you've ever been in any of the aforementioned situations and have stared in incredulity at your terminal then this talk is for you.\nWe will examine the compromised environment from the 2023 WRCCDC security competition and discuss the foundation of the competition and the infrastructure from where all the data was pulled.\n\n**Bio:**\n\u201cK\u201d Singh is currently an Incident Response Consultant at CrowdStrike. Previously an Incident Response Consultant and the Forensic Lab Manager for the Global Incident Response Practice at Cylance - \"K\" has worked with multiple Fortune 500 companies, sector-leading firms, and healthcare organizations in a variety of engagements ranging from Incident Response to Traditional \u201cDead Disk\u201d Forensics and E-Discovery.\n\nBluescreenofwin is a senior security engineer and Windows hacker. He is currently employed in the \"entertainment\" business making sure your favorite time on the Internet goes uninterrupted. He runs infrastructure for WRCCDC, brews copious amounts of delicious beer for consumption, and is a connoisseur of dank memes and handsome squidwards. Will vCISO for dogecoin.\n\n**Schedule:**\n6:00pm - 6:30pm Networking, Food & Drink\n6:30pm - 7:30pm First Presentation\n7:30pm - 8:30pm Second Presentation"

        "description": "Web APIs are a common glue that connect people and processes with digital systems all across the globe. Not surprisingly, Web APIs contribute more than 80% of the Internet traffic today. Given the importance of APIs, OWASP has recommended top-10 API specific security vulnerabilities (such as Broken Authentication/Authorization and Excessive Data Exposure problems) that organizations must address to strengthen their security posture. Albeit useful, these API specific vulnerabilities do not necessarily translate to the same business risks. For instance, two APIs from an organization with Broken Object Level Authorization (BOLA) may pose very different business risks to that organization.\n\nIn this session, we'll talk about API Risk Rating System (ARRS) that maps API specific vulnerabilities to business risks such as Legal/Contractual, Operational, Financial, Reputational and Regulatory. Similar in-principle yet different than Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), the main objective of ARRS is to prioritize API specific vulnerabilities based on their business risks. We'll describe the methodology behind the system developed using thousands of APIs that are being tracked at a global scale. We\u2019ll also share some hands-on practical scenarios.\n\nThe work presented was done by Samantha Sanchez, Jun Hee Lee, Alberto Ciconi and Baljeet Malhotra. Samantha, Jun Hee and Alberto are MSc Cybersecurity students at NYIT. Baljeet is an Adjunct Professor at NYIT, UBC, UVic, UNBC, and CEO of TeejLab Inc."
