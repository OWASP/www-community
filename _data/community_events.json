Please reach out if the event gets full and I will add room for more people.\n\n**19:00 - 19:10 \u2013 \"Welcome\" by OWASP Chapter Aarhus**\n\n**19:10 - 19:55 \u2013 \u201cA Fully Trained Jedi, You Are Not\u201d by Adam Shostack, President, Shostack + Associates**\n\nAbout the presentation:\nAs software organizations try to bring security earlier in the development processes, what can or should regular software or operations engineers know about security? Taking as given that we want them to build secure systems, that demands a shared understanding of the security issues that might come up, and agreement on what that body of knowledge might entail. Without this knowledge, they'll keep building insecure systems. With them, we can have fewer recurring problems that are trivially attackable.\n\nAbout the presenter:\nAdam is a leading expert on threat modeling, and a consultant, author and game designer. He has decades of experience delivering security. His experience ranges across the business world from founding startups to nearly a decade at Microsoft. He helped to create the CVE, serves on the Blackhat Review Board, and is an affiliate professor at the University of Washington.\n\n**19:55 \u2013 20:05 \u2013 Short break**\n\n**20:05 \u2013 20:55 \u2013 \"Let's Write Security Unit Tests\" by Eric Johnson, Principal Security Engineer at Puma Security and SANS Senior Instructor**\n\nAbout the presentation:\nDevOps teams are test obsessed, often leveraging unit testing frameworks and continuous integration (CI) tools to automate test requirements. In this talk, we will explore how security unit testing fits into DevOps, a few unit testing frameworks, and several examples that can help security teams harden their applications. Live demonstrations will show how to write security unit tests, execute the tests in a GitHub Actions workflow, and evaluate the test results.\n\nAbout the presenter:\nEric Johnson is co-founder and Principal Security Engineer at Puma Security focusing on cloud security, static code analysis, and DevSecOps automation. His experience includes performing cloud security reviews, infrastructure as code automation, application security automation, web and mobile application penetration testing, secure development lifecycle consulting, and secure code review assessments. Eric is a Senior Instructor with the SANS Institute where he authors information security courses on cloud security, DevSecOps automation, and secure coding. He delivers security training globally for SANS, as well as presents security research at conferences including RSA, BlackHat, OWASP, BSides, DevOpsDays, fwd:cloudsec, and ISSA.\n\n**20:55 \u2013 21:00 - \"Closing notes and Goodbyes\" by OWASP Chapter Aarhus**"

Did you know that 96% of these web applications contain some Open Source? Furthermore, did you know that 99% of such Open Source contain some Web APIs. You may be surprised to know that Web APIs contribute 83% of the traffic over the internet. Unfortunately, this growing API usage also means growing cybersecurity risks. Although, APIs benefit organizations immensely through accelerated innovations, newer business models, competitive differentiation, but organizations are also negatively impacted by APIs due to their weak security posture leading to business disruptions, legal and compliance issues. Gartner has actually predicted that by 2022, API abuses will be the most frequent attack vector resulting in data breaches for web applications. Given the importance of APIs for digital transformation at organizations, it is imperative for their Security, Compliance and Audit professionals to get a handle on APIs to manage various API related risks. This session will provide an overview of an API Governance framework for effective API Risk Management. This framework is inspired by the Zero Trust model that enterprises can use as a \u201cSwiss Knife\u201d for reducing their API related risks. We\u2019ll also highlight best practices and hands-on examples for API Risk Management.\n\n**Speaker: Dr. Baljeet Malhotra**\nDr. Baljeet Malhotra, is an award-winning researcher known for his work in Open Source and API Data Management. He conceptualized the world's first \"API Composition Analysis\" based on source code static analysis. He founded TeejLab in 2017 and steered the team to build API Discovery and Security\u2122, world's first comprehensive end-to-end API Management platform. Prior to TeejLab, he established the R&D unit of Black Duck Software in 2016 (acquired by Synopsys), he has also served as Research Director at SAP. He received a PhD in Computing Science from the University of Alberta and won several awards including NSERC (Canada) scholar in 2005 and Global Young Scientist (Singapore). He concurrently holds Adjunct Professor positions at the University of British Columbia, University of Victoria and University of Northern BC.\n\nRSVP for in-person:\nhttps://owasp-austin-2023-march.eventbrite.com Eventbrite(in-person)"

        "description": "Hi All!\n\nWe are excited to announce the details for our March event, at Thoughtworks Brisbane on the 30th of March!\n\n**Speaker:** Paul McCarty\n\n**Title:** The DevSecOps Playbook - a step-by-step open source guide to building a DevSecOps program for any sized org\n\n**Talk Description:** What is DevSecOps? How do I \"do\" it?\nThere's a lot of hype around DevSecOps right now, and getting two people to agree on exactly what it means can be challenging. Unfortunately, a lot of vendor narrative says it's CI/CD with some security thrown in for good measure, but DevSecOps is a lot more than that!\n\nMy career was changed by the DevOps movement, and I believe that DevSecOps should be built on top of DevOps. What does that mean? Well, what made DevOps so powerful for me in the late 2000s was that it brought together people from different departments to work together. Developers learned more about how to manage the underlying infrastructure, and ops teams learned how to use code to build and manage automation. This was powerful, and I believe we can do the same with DevSecOps: bring security teams into the processes and workflows that DevOps built. At the same time, those security teams will evolve to understand how operations and development teams work.\n\nThis talk will cover my DevSecOps Playbook, which is a step-by-step open-source guide to implementing DevSecOps for any organisation.\nThis Playbook is broken down into 5 distinct areas of domain expertise:\n\n1\\. Development Environment\n2\\. Source Code Management\n3\\. Continuous Integration / Deployment and other Automation\n4\\. Deployment Environments\n5\\. Organisational Functions\n\nThe DevSecOps Playbooks spreads the controls evenly across these 5 domains and highlights that this is a group responsibility. There is also an addendum for compliance frameworks and how they can map to the tasks and controls listed in the Playbook.\n\nIn this talk, I will outline these 5 areas and talk about the different controls and tasks in each. I will also give examples of how to implement a subset of these controls."

        "description": "Hosted by the Cyber Security & Networking Research Group, Anglia Ruskin University, OWASP (Open Web Application Security Project) Cambridge Chapter, & BCS Cybercrime Forensics SG\n\n**Background**\n\nThe BCS \u2013 Chartered Institute for IT - Cybercrime Forensics Special Interest Group (SG) promotes Cybercrime Forensics and the use of Cybercrime Forensics; of relevance to computing professionals, lawyers, law enforcement officers, academics and those interested in the use of Cybercrime Forensics and the need to address cybercrime for the benefit of those groups and of the wider public.\n\nOWASP (Open Web Application Security Project is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit worldwide charitable organization focused on improving the security of application software. Their mission is to make application security visible, so that people and organizations can make informed decisions about true application security risks.\n\nThe **Cyber Security and Networking** (**CSN**) Research Group at Anglia Ruskin University has close working strategic relationships with industry, professional bodies, law enforcement, government agencies and academia in the delivery of operationally focused applied information and application security research. We have strong international links with professional organisations such as OWASP, BCS, ISC2, IISP & the UK Cyber Security Forum amongst others. The primary aims of CSNRG are to help the UK and partner nations to tackle cybercrime, be more resilient to cyber attacks and educate its users for a more secure cyberspace and operational business environment. These will be achieved through the investigation of threats posed to information systems and understanding the impact of attacks and creation of cyber-based warning systems which gathering threat intelligence, automate threat detection, alert users and neutralising attacks. For network security we are researching securing the next generation of software defined infrastructures from the application API and control/data plane attacks. Other key work includes Computer forensic analysis, digital evidence crime scenes and evidence visualisation as well as Cyber educational approaches such as developing Capture the Flag (CTF) resources and application security programs.\n\n**Abstract : \u201cHow reliable are current forensic processes in combatting the illegal use of portable programmable devices?**\n\nThe teaching of digital forensics must be restricted, by its very nature, as we can\u2019t teach students everything. There is a new threat to best practice that we have encountered in our research, which could lead to a miscarriage of justice, where an innocent person is falsely accused of a crime. In our research, we have found that hardware devices, such as the Rubber Ducky, Bash Bunny and the O.MG cable can be used to commit or facilitate a crime. These devices leave very little forensics evidence on the target device, other than showing that a file was accessed or that an illegal picture was downloaded and viewed.\n\nThe user of the victim machine could easily be wrongly accused of a crime that they know nothing about, and they will not easily be able to prove their innocence. Forensics investigators might look no further than the access times of the file that was altered or the picture that was downloaded and viewed and would not even look for clues that might point to a hardware attack. This paper highlights the difficulties of proving that a hardware attack even took place and shows the lack of awareness amongst digital forensics investigators to this possibility.\n\n**Provisional Agenda**\n\n17:15 - Webinar waiting lobby opens\n17:30 - Start of Presentation\n18:20 \u2013 Questions & Answers\n18:30 \u2013 Estimated Finish"

But the sun is shining again, so here we go ;-)\n\nWe\u00b4d like to invite you to the next (online) meeting which fits into the previous WAF topics we had. Thus I am glad we\u00b4ll have Felipe and Juan Pablo as our guests presenting us a modern approach to an Open-Source WAF: Coraza. Coraza is a a new OWASP project, currently in lab status. It's written in Go, supports ModSecurity SecLang rulesets and is 100% compatible with the OWASP Core Rule Set.\n\nWe'll start @ 3pm as there's a time difference to where the speaker's are joining us from.\n\nIn a nutshell\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nLocation: Online\nStart: 24th of March, 3pm CET (10 am EST)\nTitle: The way to WAF in 2023 [online]\nSpeakers: [Felipe Zipitria](https://owasp2023globalappsecdublin.sched.com/speaker/felipezipitria), [Juan Pablo Tosso](https://owasp2023globalappsecdublin.sched.com/speaker/jptosso)\nNetworking: Stick around afterwards a bit if you like.\n\nAbstract\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nWe are fighting a 2023 problem by using early 2000s technology. The web has evolved. Therefore, the threats have evolved, SQL injection isn\u2019t as common as it used to be, and attackers are now looking for more complex vulnerabilities that could provide faster and bigger profits. New technologies also come with new architecture and deployment requirements, so the final question becomes, how can we protect our applications without risking false positives or decreasing performance? OWASP Coraza\u2019s goal is to solve these questions by providing a modern approach to Open-Source WAF using Golang. Coraza provides a modular, fast, developer-friendly, and efficient set of WAF capabilities that can be easily integrated into any program, it also provides connectors for Web Servers, API Gateways, HTTP frameworks, and more. Coraza is 100% compatible with OWASP Core Ruleset and extends ModSecurity capabilities to the 2020s internet.\n\nProject Links:\n[https://www.coraza.io/](https://www.coraza.io/)\n[https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza](https://github.com/corazawaf/coraza)\n[https://owasp.org/www-project-coraza-web-application-firewall/](https://owasp.org/www-project-coraza-web-application-firewall/)\n\nBios\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nFelipe has over 15 years of experience in the information security field. He regularly trains professionals from different backgrounds in application security, cloud security, and information security. He is a lecturer on Computer Security Foundations for graduates and Application Security for postgraduates at the local University where he lives, in Montevideo - Uruguay. He holds an MSc in Computer Security from the same University, UDELAR. Felipe also has contributed to the OWASP mission as a co-leader of the OWASP ModSecurity Core Rule Set Flagship project, the OWASP Coraza WAF project, and previously as Uruguay Chapter Leader.\n\nJuan is a cybersecurity researcher from Chile. He enjoys writing open-source code, hiking, biking, spending time with his children, traveling, writing, and reading. He used to be a white hat hacker, but now turned to the blue side. He is the founder and project leader of the OWASP Coraza WAF project.\n\nHow to participate\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\n\nOWASP Hamburg Meetup members who rsvp'd for the event will see the URL at the RHS and can join the video conference directly.\nPlease make sure when the talk starts your video is off and you are muted.\nWe\u00b4ll be guest of senfcall (a german membership corporation) which provides us with a privacy friendly video conference facility. Thank you!\n\nOur OWASP \"Stammtisch\"\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\\-\nOur meeting is about web applications and their (in)security and/or about IT security in general. People come together who care as a hobby or in their job about information security: developers, managers, pen testers and everybody else who's interested. The atmosphere is open and relaxed. Who's coming to sell products or services: Move on, this is not the right place. OWASP is about education and sharing (mostly) technical information.\n\nFeel free to forward our meetup URL to your colleagues or friends. They are welcome, too. Participation is free and open -- as the O in OWASP.\n\nCheers, Dirk\n\nPS: Outlook: Next meetings we'll present a new OWASP project -- OWASP Raider and a cool introduction into Rust. We plan both as hybrid sessions, OWASP Raider will be in English."

Contestants are presented with a set of challenges and puzzles which test their creativity, technical skills, vulnerability-finding skills and problem-solving ability. The challenges usually cover a number of categories and when solved, each yields a \u201cflag\u201d which is submitted to a real-time scoring service. The difficulty levels are from beginner to advanced.\n\nPlease note that unlike our OWASP London Chapter \u2018s previous CTFs this is not a secure coding tournament, but a proper \"Hacking CTF\". The challenges will be around finding and exploiting application vulnerabilities, not vulnerabilities in the source code.\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Please **bring your own** **LAPTOP** and a **CHARGER** for it.\nTop 3 scorers will win exciting prizes generously provided by Invicti and other cyber security technology vendors.\n\nParticipation is FREE, but the **number of seats is strictly limited to 50** and **[registration is required](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/574787925157/)** to attend.\n\n**Please remember to bring your own laptop!**\n\n**IMPORTANT**: By participating in this activity you agree to abide by the\n\n**OWASP Code of Conduct** and **Invicti CTF Rules**:\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy our events, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

API security poses unique challenges to builders and defenders, and many of your existing detection and protection measures may prove to be ineffective.\n\nJoin Colin as he draws on his experience from curating the industry's biggest API security resource (APISecurity.io) in exploring the following:\nCrash course on the OWASP API Security Top 10 (and how it differs from the OWASP Top 10)\nA whistle-stop tour of some of the biggest API breaches over the past 18 months, taking a look at what went wrong, the impact, and most importantly, how to prevent such attacks.\nFinally, he will present the top techniques for protecting your APIs from attack, starting with secure development practices through to API protection and threat detection.\n\nThe content will be technical, with demos and code samples, and based on real-world breaches. By the end of the session, you will have an understanding of the API Security Top 10, and have a working knowledge of how to protect your APIs, either at a code level or using runtime protections.\n*Bio:*\nColin has a long and varied career in producing secure, rugged, and trustable software and hardware products covering a range of industries from military, consumer, medical, automotive to financial services. In the last decade, he has become a sought-after evangelist and consultant in building AppSec programs, and the latest developments in DevSecOps. His greatest passion is for teaching and inspiring others to produce software we can trust, either delivering webinars, in-person events or speaking to the C-level.\n\nCurrently, he is the Chief Technology Evangelist with 42Crunch, the curator of the APISecurity.io newsletter, and is writing the industry\u2019s first book on defending APIs.\n\n**Managing APIs securely**\n*Abstract:*\nWhen an organization offers an API, the API needs to become a Managed API. This means that lifecycle management, security, and throttling resources become an important aspect of API Management, as well as the ability of developers to find, explore and subscribe to the API to use them.\n\nDuring the presentation, Rob will zoom into these aspects and how an API Manager can help you with security and throttling (including schema validation and advanced scenarios) while at the same time making the API easily available to your target developers (inside or outside the organization).\n\nIn the second part, he will elaborate on the \u201cshiny frontend / dirty backend\u201d. This is an API frontend that accesses legacy systems, databases, but also the integration of a set of APIs etc., thus enabling services that use older technology or proprietary interfaces to have a modern appearance to the outside world, e.g. exposing a legacy insurance policy administration system as an API.\n\nThirdly, we will look at the way you can implement the Mastodon API. Since Elon Musk acquired Twitter l ast year, alternative platforms like Mastodon have become more popular. It might be that this becomes a viable channel to communicate with clients for some organizations.\n*Bio:*\nRob has 30 years of experience in IT in such roles as developer, analyst, project manager, business consultant, and management consultant. He is currently Head of Training Services and Integration Consultant at Yenlo, responsible for the development and the actual training of Yenlo\u2019s clients and consultants.\n\nNext to these responsibilities, Rob is also an avid blogger with almost 200 blogs on innovation on Frankwatching, more than 150 blogs on WSO2 on Yenlo\u2019s website and many other blogs on various other sites. Rob is also a regular contributor to BNR Zaken Doen radio show on the area of technology and innovation.\n\n**Delegates may be asked to provide a valid proof of photo ID (such as a driving licence or passport) to enter the venue.**"

The address to their office is 11493 Sunset Hills Rd Suite 100, Reston, VA 20190. Attendees are free to park anywhere in the Carahsoft parking lot. The event will be in the CarahCafe, which is the room on the left side when entering the Carahsoft office. Carahsoft will also create welcome signs that say \"OWASP NoVA Meeting\" to guide attendees when they enter the building.\n\nAbstract:\nThe last decade has seen an increased adoption of security practices across the development landscape. It is now standard practice to perform penetration testing, run threat modeling, teach developers about security, push left, and have zero trust. Or is it? Come join Seth as he explores why everything old is new again. See the security failures that existed then and how they still exist from modern examples. Also explore the strategies that actually catch these problems early in the development lifecycle without spending a fortune on security snake oil."

        "description": "Over the past few years OWASP Suffolk has been bringing you free events to show you cyber security best practices. We discussed creating strong passwords, patching and backing up, OSINT, API Security, SCA and RASP, and many other subjects. In this event we hope to cement that knowledge by showing you the view from the other side of the fence.\n\nIn this live interactive demonstration we will show you what a web target looks like from the perspective of an attacker. With the use of a vulnerable target that has not followed security best practices we will show you just how easy it is for an attacker to gain access to your computer, it's data and resources. With each step of the attack we will demonstrate techniques and tools while discussing what could of been done to mitigate each step of the attack.\n\nBy thinking like a Hacker and seeing your \"defences\" from their point of view we hope to show you how important following cyber security best practices really is.\n\nAttendees of the OWASP Suffolk Fight Club events will be familiar with the format of this event, except that this will be scripted with interactive Q&A. The vulnerable target will be a virtual machine created for the purpose of learning.\n\nAgenda:\n\n* OWASP updates\n* Live interactive demonstration of a web attack with Q&A throughout\n\nDisclaimer: As always our events are designed to educate. Any tools and techniques demonstrated are for informative purposes only. We do not endorse their use for malicious purposes.\n\nThis talk will not be recorded."

Principal, Office of the CISO, AWS Security\n\nSecurity is everyone\u2019s job, not just those who have security in their job title. We are all working towards the same goal of shipping software securely. You\u2019ll hear some approaches that AWS takes in their distributed environment & how you can apply those to your own organization. There will be a bit of tech, but this talk is going to be more on the distributed ownership & decision making aspect of how to ship software.\n\nThis event is sponsored by **Forward Security** \\- thanks for providing us space and food\\."
