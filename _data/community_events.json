Traditional tactics like web application firewalls won\u2019t work for APIs because they have limits to the level of protection they can provide. The challenge of securing APIs is due to two things. First, APIs are built differently making them harder to protect for traditional security solutions looking just at the network layer vs the source code and two teams don\u2019t have the right tools required for full API discovery to truly know what APIs are in use.\n\nJoin Dr. Anirban Banerjee as he discusses:\n\n* Why API security efforts need to incorporate both 3rd party and internal API traffic\n* What\u2019s causing the surge of API-led attacks\n* Why have traditional tools not maintained the sophistication needed to protect APIs in flight\n* Why teams need to locate and catalog every single API for true auditability\n* Q&A"

It presents the three main avenues of attack against Large Language Models (LLMs): direct attacks on the LLMs themselves, compromises in the infrastructure and integrations, and weaknesses in applications. The presentation offers in-depth examples, particularly focusing on \"social engineering\" methods, to illustrate the techniques and consequences of these security breaches.\n\n 19:15 to 19:45 - Top 5 Open Source Tools All Developers Should Know About!\n\nRaz Probstein - Solution Engineer @ Jit\n\nThe Minimum Viable Security (MVS) approach simplifies the integration of security measures into config files, apps, and CI/CD processes using open source tools. This talk focuses on incorporating five key security controls into the CI/CD pipeline, utilizing tools like Bandit, Gitleaks, OSV-Scanner, KICS, and OWASP\u2019s ZAP. These controls, along with custom measures for enforcing Multi-Factor Authentication via Github Security, establish a foundational security framework from the initial code, allowing continuous improvement as applications evolve over time. Code examples and demos will be presented in the session.\n\n 19:45 - 20:15 - Recent Supply Chain Code Attacks\n\nYoad Fekete - Co-Founder & CEO @ Myrror Security\n\nJoin us for a deep-dive into the world of recent software supply chain attacks and how to defend against them.\nIn this lecture, we will discuss the difference between a supply chain attack and a vulnerability, and explore why there has been a significant increase in these types of attacks in the past couple of years.\nWe will showcase various vectors for these attacks with recent attacks examples.\nThe highlight? A technical demo of an attack, similar to the UA-Parser/Ledger Connect kit malicious package attacks.\n\n=====================================================================\n\nThis event is sponsored by Bright Security in collaboration with OWASP Israel.\n\nJoin us at the event physically as we will not include Zoom or remote participation this time."

We have invited Karol Przystalski from Codete, who will share his thoughts about security of ML models. Then we will have a discussion about how wide use of generative AI in coding will influence application security.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Machine learning security (Karol Przystalski)**\nMachine learning (ML) and other terms related to it became buzzwords. Many companies would like to introduce machine learning models, even if there are simpler solutions. In the presentation, we show recent security issues related to machine learning models. Next, we do an overview of possible security issues that can happen during building such models. Finally, we demonstrate how to prevent the most popular security problems related to ML on the examples of applications in e-commerce, fintech, and other sectors.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion on how AI and Generative AI impact the security of application code**. Are AI-powerd tools a boon or a potential risk? What risks emerge when software engineers start using GenAI? Is the code produced by GenAI more or less secure? Are tools designed for code, such as GitHub Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer, superior to GPT? Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in the discussion. Share your experiences and thoughts, exchange the latest insights, and learn from each other. Whether you are an experienced software engineer, a newcomer to the world of AI, or simply curious about the influence of Generative AI on code security, your perspective is valuable.\n3. There will be also a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion). [Please submit your ideas](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5) or just show up.\n4. Job announcements. If you are an employer, there will be a chance to present who you are looking for.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this** with friends and in social media.\n\n**Sponsor wydarzenia**\n[Codete](https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcodete.com%2F&data=05%7C01%7C%7C6abbe7bee00040f7795508db2938e5da%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638149096573255135%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=%2BYKLHBngHjVS6%2F0INX6RRWCdgE5XHx4jzAxrFguqwrI%3D&reserved=0) is a software company based in Poland that specializes in custom software development and IT consulting.

        "description": "*Hacking a SaaS: A Practical Guide to Understanding Attackers and Defending Against Them*\n\nIn this talk, we will delve into the mindset of an attacker and explore the vulnerabilities they exploit in SaaS systems. We will cover the following topics:\n\n* What motivates hackers to target SaaS systems (5%)\n* How hackers conduct reconnaissance on SaaS systems (50%)\n* The anatomy of exploit chains (40%)\n* Strategies for defending against attacks (5%)\n\nOur goal is to provide a practical guide to understanding attackers and defending against them. We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur February host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter.\n\n*[This was our January event, which was canceled for weather. We have rescheduled it for February.]*"
