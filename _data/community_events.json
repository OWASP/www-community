        "description": "In this talk, we will take a hands-on look at some of the latest OWASP MAS developments, in particular the new MASWE (Mobile Application Security Weakness Enumeration). This talk will introduce the concepts of \"weaknesses\", \"atomic tests\" and \"demos\" that are the basis of the upcoming MASTG v2. Attendees will gain practical knowledge through detailed examples that show the journey from definition to implementation using both static and dynamic analysis techniques available in MASTG. In addition, discover the newly developed MAS test apps designed to streamline research and improve the development of robust MAS tests.\n\nDon't miss this opportunity to improve your mobile app security skills and make your apps hack-proof. Whether you're looking to bolster your defenses or learn how to uncover vulnerabilities, this session will provide you with the cutting-edge resources you need to stay ahead in mobile security!"

Following the survey last month of when you'd like to have these meetings, 66.7% of you told us you'd prefer the last Wednesday of the month - so, it shall be.\n\nIn our last meetup, attendees voted for [Dr. Watson's Bar in the CBD](https://www.thesherlockholmes.com.au/dr-watsons-bar/) as our location this month.

There's no speakers, or sponsors; just a facilitator, with the expectation that you'll join the conversations. Broadly, the idea is that you're swinging by after work, for a regular catch-up with our peers over dinner (with F&B at your own cost) with a known format.\n\\-\\-\\-\n**So, what's happening?**\nThe format:\n\n1. At 6pm all attendees arrive, and order (and pay for) their own meals - we'll do the rest while waiting for the meals to arrive and as we eat.\n2. All attendees write down on a card 1-2 AppSec/ProdSec related topics they'd like to discuss.\n3. We'll all each cast 3 votes on the cards we'd like to discuss.\n4. We'll sort the cards, and discuss the topics with the top 3-4 highest votes. Starting with the topic with the highest votes.\n5. After 5(?) minutes, we all decide if we'd like to continue or move on to the next topic.\n6. If we continue, after 15(?) minutes, we all move on to the next topic of discussion.\n7. At 7pm, we wrap up and officially end. Before everyone leaves, we vote on the next restaurant that we'll meet at.\n\nThis is [inspired by Lean Coffee](https://agilecoffee.com/leancoffee/), and intended for participants to be collaborators in the conversation focused on AppSec & ProdSec topics.\nFor the location selection, here are the considerations we work with:\n\n1. It must be within 1 \"city block\" of the Melbourne Free Tram Zone.\n2. The typical price for a whole meal (without alcohol) should be under $50 per person.\n3. It must allow individual orders - you'd be ordering and paying for your own meal.\n4. It will need to have seating space for the group to say, just walk-in to the restaurant ( this may change if it grows beyond 10 regular attendees ).\n5. It must be quiet enough for us to have meaningful conversations.\n6. It must not be a restaurant we've been to in the past 6 months. (Just to keep things fresh )\n\nAlso, although we use the word \u201crestaurant\u201d this is used broadly to mean food establishment - if we\u2019re all keen on hitting up a decent kebab place, that works. As a courtesy to the venue, there's an expectation that you'd order something there.\n\nSee you there.\nThank you."

We will start with the fundamentals of GitHub Actions and put those into practice with a Hello World test. Then we will look at how to create a dashboard that displays the current state of your repository. Finally, we will resolve one of the failing dashboard metrics by implementing an automated scan. This is intended to be a hands-on talk. Bring your laptop and set up a GitHub account before the meeting begins."

Our Chapter serves central Germany, particularly within the Rhine-Main (Hesse) region, as a platform to discuss and share information and application security topics. Anyone who is interested and enthusiastic about application security or security in general is welcome. All meetings are free and open. You do not have to be an OWASP member.\n\nThere will also be plenty of time to socialize before and after the event.\n\n_What are we going to talk about?\n\n**1\\. Talk:** **Security at Scale - Mastering Cloud Security in the Cyberwar Era**\n\n*Dominik Sowinski, Cybersecurity Architect & Cybersecurity Community Lead, Siemens*\n\nIn the midst of rapid cloud transformation, industrial organisations face an ever-evolving cyber threat landscape, exacerbated by global events such as the war in Ukraine. This presentation will address the latest APT activities and the significant risks they pose to cloud infrastructures and critical industrial operations. We will explore cutting-edge strategies, technical considerations and essential processes to rapidly adapt and secure cloud environments at scale against these relentless threats. The presentation will help you understand how to fortify cloud applications and infrastructure in this dynamic threat landscape.\n\n**2\\. Talk: Let's talk vulnerabilities**\n\n*Vinit K., Independent security research and threat hunting*\n\nA talk and live demo on cybersecurity threats involving terminal emulators and SSH. We will explore how URL handling in iTerm2 and Hyper can be abused for code execution, as well as delve into the recent CVE-2023-51385 vulnerability, which allows unexpected code execution via SSH ProxyCommand. The session will include interactive segments where the audience can contribute exploit ideas and deepen their understanding of these critical security issues.\n\n_Afterwards?\nWe will pre- and conclude the evening with the possibility of **socializing** at the venue with **free food and cold & hot drinks**. For everyone who's interested, we will continue socializing at the Bockenheimer Weinkontor afterward.\n\n_When?\nOur Meetup takes place on 31.07.2024 from 18.00 to 21.30 o'clock CEST.\n\n_Where?\nCHECK24 Frankfurt is located at Speicherstra\u00dfe 55 in Frankfurt am Main, ca. 15min within walking distance of Frankfurt Hauptbahnhof.\n\n_Interested in **giving a talk** yourself?\nSubmit your talk here: https://www.papercall.io/owasp-chapter-frankfurt\n\n_And now?\nSave the date, **spread the word,** and bring your friends and colleagues along to our event.\n\n_Follow Us!\nAlso, follow us here and refer to our [OWASP Frankfurt site](https://owasp.org/www-chapter-germany/stammtische/frankfurt/) for information, including slides and recordings of previous presentations\n\nWe're looking forward to seeing you at our event!"
