Runtime security enables all four of these key capabilities:\n\nFinding zero-day vulnerabilities in custom code and libraries in real time\nFinding known vulnerabilities in libraries and understanding their exploitability\nPreventing vulnerabilities from being exploited in production\nCreating a digital blueprint of security to drive threat modeling, penetration testing, and risk management\n\nIn essence, Runtime Security is a comprehensive approach to app/API security that can replace your suite of legacy tools. Runtime security is already in use in hundreds of thousands of critical apps/APIs in some of the biggest companies in the world. During our session, you\u2019ll learn how to use Runtime Security to streamline application security, accelerate innovation, and improve security at the same time.\n\nSpeaker:\nJeff Williams"

Dar\u00fcber hinaus stelle ich ein Open-Source Werkzeug vor, um diese Infos aus diversen Produkten an einer zentralen Stelle auf Verwundbarkeiten hin zu \u00fcberpr\u00fcfen und wie ein solches Tool bei der kontinuierlichen Software Composition Analysis (SCA) unterst\u00fctzt, um Risiken in der Software Supply Chain fr\u00fchzeitig zu identifizieren.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich werde ich zeigen, welche Ma\u00dfnahmen noch sinnvoll und notwendig sind, um eine sichere Software-Supply-Chain zu etablieren: vom ersten Commit bis zum Deployment in Produktion.\n\n# **Generelles zum OWASP-Stammtisch**\n\nBei unseren offenen Treffen geht es um Software und deren Sicherheit im Internet und/oder IT-Security allgemein. Hier treffen sich Menschen, die sich beruflich oder privat mit IT-Sicherheit besch\u00e4ftigen: Entwickler, Manager, \u201ePentester\u201c und alle an (Web)sicherheit interessierte. Die Atmosph\u00e4re ist offen und locker. Uns geht's um den Erfahrungsaustausch, Technikschnack und um's Netzwerken. Wer Produkte oder Dienstleistungen verkaufen will, ist hier falsch. Ihr seid herzlich willkommen, euren Kollegen oder Bekannten einen Hinweis auf unsere Treffen weiterzuleiten. Alle Treffen sind frei, f\u00fcr jeden offen und kostenlos.\n\nSch\u00f6nen Gru\u00df, Bj\u00f6rn / Dirk"

We're thrilled to roll out an exceptional DevSecOps workshop in collaboration with **OWASP LA** and offered by [deepfactor](https://www.deepfactor.io/). This workshop will walk you through the process of using runtime analysis using OSS (Open Source Software) tools to identify which vulnerable components in an application are actually loaded into memory and, therefore, represent a higher risk to your business. You\u2019ll learn how to be a hero in your organization by helping your dev teams save time and fix a significantly smaller number of high-risk vulnerabilities!.\n\n## **Abstract**\n\nNew vulnerabilities are disclosed every day in dependencies that you or your team may be using. But how do you know if you are actually using the vulnerable code? This workshop will show you how to use two different types of tools to analyze reachability (1) static call graphs and (2) runtime analysis, and help in deciding if the vulnerability needs to be prioritized based on your own code usage.\n\n## **Workshop Overview**\n\nThe workshop will be broken into several modules; introductory modules will cover the workshop organization and administrative matters (installing and configuring the tools used in the workshop). Subsequent modules will give an outline of what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important and compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis).\n\nNext, the workshop will present two short exercises, intended for the attendees to gain hands-on experience using both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered. Subsequently, the following module will walk through how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions. The languages chosen are merely representative; the skills learned in the workshop are equally applicable to other languages.\n\nThe workshop will conclude with two modules which will present a short overview of commercial tools and a conclusion/wrap-up/Q&A session.\n\n## **Outcome/Learnings**\n\n* Understand what vulnerability reachability is and why it is important\n* Compare/contrast the two main ways of understanding reachability (static call graphs and runtime analysis)\n* Via hands-on experience, use both types of tools against real applications with real vulnerabilities. Interpreted languages (Java) and compiled languages (C/C++/Go) will be covered.\n* Learn how to interpret the results obtained from the exercises and draw conclusions\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

And forcing security onto developers often has an adverse effect. In this talk we will share the journey we have been making at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) to get Development teams to adopt DevSecOps in a way that works best for them. Topics that will be discussed include Secure Development training, Security Champions, Threat Modeling and using the right tooling.\n\n*Bio:*\nSebastiaan Rijnbout has a background as .NET developer and has worked in that field for over 12 years, but since 2017 he has started focusing on AppSec and Dev(Sec)Ops.\n\nWhen getting teams and organisations to adopt DevSecOps, Sebastiaan will look at all aspects of DevSecOps (People, Process and Technology) like setting up developer training programs and security champion programs, rolling out company-wide Security tooling and improving working processes. But always keeping a focus on making things easy and efficient for developers.\n\nIn his current role at the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (KVK) Sebastiaan acts as Product Owner for 4 Dev(Sec)Ops support teams. These teams are responsible for enabling all development teams at KVK to deliver secure and high-quality software as efficiently as possible.\n\n**Cracking the API: Challenges in IoT and Modern Applications**\n*Abstract:*\nSecuring API\u2019s is about more than just an endpoint, it\u2019s about the data shared, customer privacy, and the access we give to unauthorised parties. Now as we are connecting more devices than ever, to more third parties than ever, securing APIs needs an offensive mindset from the design phase.\n\nIn this talk I\u2019ll go over some of the techniques I use when testing, common issues I\u2019ve found and their impact, and the state of IoT and modern web applications.\n\nSecurity issues can arise from misconceptions early in the software process, so I\u2019ll also discuss how we might mitigate some of these with thoughtful design, architecture and development.\n\n*Bio:*\nFrom user experience to software engineering, Yianna has a diverse background with one thing in common - exploring the intersection between human interaction and technology. Currently she is an Offensive and Application Security Engineer at Xebia. Working in tech teams and researching new offensive techniques remains a daily drive for her. She\u2019s passionate about giving back to the community, having presented at DEFCON, hosted security meetups, delivered workshops, contributed to OWASP Low Code / No Code, as well as building and contributing to open source tooling."

        "description": "Hi,\nWe are Polish chapter of [OWASP](https://owasp.org/) \\- worldwide\\, non\\-profit organisation focused on application security issues\\.\n\nSubject of our upcoming March meeting will be \"Security in development lifecycle\". How to achieve high quality, secure product without scarifying the \"time to market\"? What is more important - visible features or \"transparent\" security? How to convince all the team that they should commit to overall security of the code? What are the best security related initiatives that works in the real life?\nIf you are finding these questions relevant to your work or if you want to share your ideas for achieving secure applications - don't hesitate and join our meeting.\n\nWe have invited Monika Krysiak - QA specialist and product owner, to share her experience and ideas with introducing security into development process. Then we want you to share your ideas - what works and what not. How can we do something more than security testing at later stages of application development?\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Smuggling Security Into a Software Project. A Guide for Cunning QAs (Monika Krysiak)**\nAs Quality Assurance specialists, we are often overlooked in security processes. Developers might think of us as whiny negative Nancys but in reality, we have a lot of impact. After all, we won't allow releasing a defective product into production. I believe that QAs should start security testing and simple vulnerability assessment as the first line of defense. During my presentation, I'll show you how I've successfully done that in my past projects.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion on strategies and best practices for embedding security into the entire development lifecycle**. In today's fast-paced development environments, ensuring security isn't just about running tests or applying patches at the end of the cycle. It's about integrating security practices seamlessly into every phase of the software development lifecycle. This discussion will explore practical strategies, challenges, and success stories related to incorporating security from the early design stages to deployment and beyond. Let's brainstorm together on how we can foster a culture where security is everyone's responsibility, not just an afterthought.\n3. There will be also a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion). [Please submit your ideas](https://forms.gle/7JFiD3z2tKifogvs5) or just show up.\n4. Job announcements. If you are an employer, there will be a chance to present who you are looking for.\n\nPlease RSVP and save the date!\nIf you have a minute, **please share this invitation** with friends and in your social media."
