Kindly use use the below link to register:\n\n**[https://www.eventbrite.com/e/january-meetup-tickets-790684256897?aff=oddtdtcreator](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/january-meetup-tickets-790684256897?aff=oddtdtcreator)**\n\nHappy New year, Please join us at Synopsys HQ in Sunnyvale to Meet-Up and discuss some of the challenges that we face securing software and building TRUST into the products/services that we use daily. Along with informative talks around AppSec, there will also be some awesome food & drinks, as well as access to an outdoor patio for network throughout the event.\n\nBrief agenda below:\n5:00 \u2013 6:00: Networking/Food\n6:00 \u2013 6:25: What is Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)?\n6:30 \u2013 6:55: Coverage - The Missing Link of WebApp/API Security Testing\n6:55 \u2013 7:10 : Short Break\n7:10 \u2013 7:35: How AI will empower and hurt security\n7:35 \u2013 8:00: Networking\n\n**What is Application Security Posture Management (ASPM)?**\nCompanies adopt many application security testing (AST) tools to pinpoint critical software issues and keep compliant with OWASP standards. Yet despite this AppSec investment, they still fail to get an accurate view of risk, and struggle integrate testing, triage, and remediation within developer workflows. This has driven the evolution of application security posture management (ASPM).\nIn this session, we\u2019ll dive into:\n\\- What is ASPM\\, and capabilities that a comprehensive solution should have\n\\- Best practices on using ASPM to accelerate AppSec transformation and consolidate data\\, workflows\\, and visibility\n\\- How ASPM is central to helping your teams keep up with OWASP compliance and mitigate software risk at scale\\.\n\n**Speaker:-** Natasha is a Senior Product Marketing Manager at Synopsys, driving go-to-market strategy for Software Risk Manager, an ASPM solution. She has worked for ten years in the cybersecurity and enterprise networking space. Prior to Synopsys, Natasha was with ServiceNow, where she managed product marketing initiatives for ServiceNow Security Operations, a SOAR platform for incident and vulnerability management. She has also held roles in product marketing and software product management at Imperva and A10 Networks.\nTalk#2: **Coverage - The Missing Link of WebApp/API Security Testing**\nMost DAST tools will boast about how many hundreds of thousands of attacks/checkers/vulns they scan for. But most still have a hard time automatically finding all of the pages/endpoints/actions in modern applications (e.g. SPAs) and APIs. Not to mention figuring out how to test everything they find in both a meaningful way and a reasonable amount of time. After all these years and entire markets built on web scraping, why is crawling for security testing still so hard? Why isn't an OpenAPI/Swagger spec enough to properly test an API? And what are we doing about it? In this session we'll dive in to those missing links and explore how we can actually feel confident in our automated testing coverage.\n\n**Speaker2**: Steve Chappell, SW Manager & API Security Evangelist\nSteve has done a little bit of everything in his 10 years at Synopsys (R&D, Sales, and yes, he even got suckered into Marketing for a while), but currently loves his role as a SW Engineering Manager, leading a team developing novel dynamic testing engines targeting webapps and APIs. When he's not evangelizing Application/API security, you might find him playing or creating word/puzzle games at the top of a multi-pitch climb drinking a craft or Belgian beer... or coaching youth sports.\n\n**Talk3#** How AI will empower and hurt security\n\n* How AI will help security teams:\n* Things we've seen work such as cross team collaboration, empowering security teams to remediate, freeing up engineering etc.\n* Thing we've seen not work in the market and might take a long time to mature for example complex log analysis\n\nHow adversaries will use AI to breach systems\n* rewriting malware signatures\n* more complex supply chain attacks that are harder to detect\n* more advanced social engineering and spoofing\n* more advanced phishing\n* more sophisticated penetration and reconnaissance\n\n**Speaker**: Ahmad Sadeddin is a 3x founder (1x exit). He lead various products at Coupa for over 6 years after they acquired his last startup (Riskopy). Corgea was born from his frustration at the manual and inefficient processes that companies take around data protection."

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite.

Learn why every SCA tool is wrong, and how to deal with it.\n**Abstract**: With the rise of AI-fueled by Python-based libraries, it has become of paramount importance to scan Python-based projects and their dependencies for OSS vulnerabilities. Python relies on package managers like pip or conda to manage declared dependencies. Dependencies are declared in manifest files which the package manager uses to install the correct version of the required dependency. However, Python\u2019s dependency management system coupled with its dynamic type nature makes it an especially challenging language to deal with.\n\nOf particular focus is the phenomenon of phantom dependencies which are unreported dependencies in a project's manifest profile. These hidden dependencies, which are often provided dependencies (which is especially true for libraries such as tensorflow and pytorch which are essential for AI), challenge software composition analysis (SCA) of Python code, impacting the reliability of vulnerability results.\n\nFor example, in the case of OpenAI's baseline codebase, there is a dependency on tensorflow that is not explicitly declared and is hence a phantom dependency This can cause unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. We show how using type-aware program analysis to create call graphs and perform reachability helps us determine the correct dependency set for a codebase irrespective of what is in the manifest.\n\nProgram analysis aims to extract information from software programs to enhance reliability, security, and performance. This session explores program analysis, specifically reachability analysis in Python, and delves into phantom dependencies - often overlooked in Python applications.\n\nPython's dynamic typing and interpreted nature make it a challenging subject for reachability analysis. The lack of type information makes it hard to precisely determine what dependency/features are used in the code.\n\nIn summary, program analysis, including Python's unique challenges, is essential in software development. Phantom dependencies in Python underscore the significance of meticulous dependency management for code reliability and security. Understanding these concepts is vital for Python developers aiming to build robust software. This abstract sheds light on program analysis complexities and the pitfalls of phantom dependencies, offering valuable insights into Python development and software reliability.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\n\n**Title**: Leveraging personal effectiveness to build your life and career.\n**Abstract**: In an age of generative Ai, we no longer rely on our technical prowess or mastery of tools to sustain our careers.

We have invited Karol Przystalski from Codete, who will share his thoughts about security of ML models. Then we will have a discussion about how wide use of generative AI in coding will influence application security.\n\nAgenda:\n\n1. **Machine learning security (Karol Przystalski)**\nMachine learning (ML) and other terms related to it became buzzwords. Many companies would like to introduce machine learning models, even if there are simpler solutions. In the presentation, we show recent security issues related to machine learning models. Next, we do an overview of possible security issues that can happen during building such models. Finally, we demonstrate how to prevent the most popular security problems related to ML on the examples of applications in e-commerce, fintech, and other sectors.\n2. After the break, we will be hosting a **discussion on how AI and Generative AI impact the security of application code**. Are AI-powerd tools a boon or a potential risk? What risks emerge when software engineers start using GenAI? Is the code produced by GenAI more or less secure? Are tools designed for code, such as GitHub Copilot and AWS CodeWhisperer, superior to GPT? Everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate in the discussion. Share your experiences and thoughts, exchange the latest insights, and learn from each other. Whether you are an experienced software engineer, a newcomer to the world of AI, or simply curious about the influence of Generative AI on code security, your perspective is valuable.\n3. There will be also a room for **short lightning talks** with discussion (typical format is 5-10 minute talk followed by 5-10 minute discussion).

We will share lots of hacker tips and tricks, and provide plenty of quiz moments to train your intuition. Our focus will be on vulnerabilities that hackers actually care about, rather than theoretical ones. All of our examples will be based on real-world exploit chains, and we will explore multiple vulnerabilities chained together to create media-news-headline-worthy outcomes. By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how attackers think and operate, and you will be better equipped to defend against their attacks.\n\nOur January host and sponsor is Solutional Inc, and the talk will take place in their Portland office at 301 SE 2nd Ave.\n\nPlease RSVP here if you are planning to attend.\n\nThis is a monthly event of OWASP's Portland chapter."

Rapid evolvement of tools, methods, and novel approaches is prompting businesses to swiftly adopt fresh solutions to harness the potential of this emerging paradigm. However, as new technologies, methodologies, and work practices are introduced, hackers also adapt and innovate, always staying one step ahead.\nThis session led by cybersecurity specialist Krister Hedfors will explore the techniques that hackers use to leverage, manipulate, and exploit GenAI systems, such as ChatGPT and Code Llama. He will also give an introduction to OWASP top 10 list for Large Language Models (LLM).\n\nThe meeting will start with a mingle at 18:00, the main presentation beginning (with online attendees) at 18:30"
