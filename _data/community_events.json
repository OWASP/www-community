As enterprises and consumers increasingly interact with a vast array of digital services, safeguarding accounts from compromise becomes a daunting task. Weak security measures not only expose businesses to financial loss and brand damage but also lead to unhappy customers. Identity Threat Detection and Response (ITDR) solutions offer a powerful way to reduce the risk of account fraud. In this insightful talk, we will explore typical account-related attacks illustrated with real-world examples. We will also discuss the critical non-functional requirements that make ITDR solutions truly effective.\n**Speaker:** **Bertold Kolics**\nBertold Kolics is a Software Testing Lead at Verosint (verosint.com), where he focuses on enhancing identity security through innovative solutions. His previous experience includes engineering identity provisioning and directory products at Sun Microsystems and UnboundID.\n\n\\-\\-\\-\\-\nIf you would prefer to attend in person, please see [Eventbrite](https://owasp-austin-2025-august.eventbrite.com)."

But while powerful, these tools carry risks: trained on vast public datasets, they inherit bad patterns without necessarily ensuring secure application development. In this talk, we'll share five key lessons for security engineers and developers to improve code security:\n\n1. Implement guardrails\n2. Get real-time security signal\n3. Watch your dependency blast radius\n4. Compensate for non-determinism\n5. Invest in prompt engineering\n\nBio:\n**Nate Michalov** is a seasoned application security professional with over 12 years of diverse experience. Throughout his career, Nate has contributed to organizations such as Endor Labs, Apiiro, Snyk, Veracode, and Annkissam, where he has focused on securing digital ecosystems while aligning technological strategies with business objectives. In various roles including customer success architect, senior sales engineer, and senior SAST specialist, Nate has consistently tackled complex challenges at the intersection of business and technology. Known for his collaborative approach and dedication to staying informed about emerging trends, Nate is recognized as a trusted advisor in promoting innovation and resilience in application security.\n\nTopic 2\n**Title: Past, Present and Future of Automatic Code Remediation**\n\nAbstract: Academic projects, linters, and IDE helpers provided a foundation for simple automatic code refactoring, but lacked the depth to address complex code issues found by tools. Recently, the landscape of tools used to change code saw explosive growth. Several open source code mutation frameworks have emerged, allowing expressive and impactful code transformations. LLMs have also jumped into the picture, promising power and delivering \u201ccool\u201d \u2013 but also towing chaos. We\u2019ll explore the capabilities of these tools, including synergistic strategies \u2013 all towards answering the question: \u201care we ready to automatically fix code issues?\u201d Finally, we\u2019ll look at the horizon and make the case that the era of self-healing software is approaching quickly, even if it looks a little different than what you might expect.\n\nBio:\nLeading tech innovator **David Hafley**, Head of Engineering at Pixee, blends leadership with tech expertise.

That mental model leads to confident failure: endless scanning, training, and compliance rituals that rarely stop real threats. In this talk, we\u2019ll re-examine AppSec\u2019s go-to tools \u2014 threat modeling, scanning, pentesting, firewalling \u2014 through a new lens, so you can see why they keep falling short. The problem isn\u2019t effort. It\u2019s context. You\u2019re trying to secure a living, breathing software city using a blueprint for a castle.\n\nWe\u2019ll introduce a new model: Runtime Security. This isn\u2019t theory \u2014 it\u2019s about observing real production environments, with real users, data, connections, and threats. We\u2019re not trying to secure a castle. Your application ecosystem is a massive, dynamic city \u2014 alive, interconnected, and always under construction. It needs monitoring, coordination, fast response, and resilience \u2014 not moats and silos. We\u2019ll show how teams are using runtime visibility and feedback loops to focus on what matters, adapt quickly, and prove they\u2019re making a difference. The most serious AppSec threat isn\u2019t in your code \u2014 it\u2019s in your head. Shift your thinking, and everything else starts to fall into place.\n\n**Thanks to our SPONSOR**: *[Contrast Security](https://www.contrastsecurity.com/)*\n*You can't stop what you can't see*\n*Application Detection and Response for Modern Enterprises*\n*Stop attacks in your applications and APIs from development to production*\n\n**CODE OF CONDUCT**\nWe hope you enjoy the event, we care deeply about inclusivity and diversity so that OWASP is a comfortable and welcoming community for everyone.

Introduction to OWASP Ottawa, Public Announcements.\n2. **\"Doing More with Less: An Adaptive, Label-Efficient Approach to Fraud Detection from Day One\" with Bahar Afshar**\n3. \"**Beyond APIs: MCP Security for AI Integrations\" with Harsh Makwana**\n\n**Abstracts:**\n\n***Doing More with Less: An Adaptive, Label-Efficient Approach to Fraud Detection from Day One with Bahar Afshar.***\nDetecting fraud in financial systems is like finding a needle in a haystack; fraudulent transactions are rare, labeling them is expensive, and sometimes, we don\u2019t have any labels at all. In this talk, I\u2019ll present a new approach that tackles these challenges by combining different learning strategies in an adaptive way. We\u2019ll explore how to start detecting fraud even when labeled examples are extremely limited and how we can prioritize the most suspicious cases using smart, explainable tools. The goal is to make fraud detection not just more accurate but also more efficient and easier to understand for human experts. Whether you're working in cybersecurity, finance, or just curious about the future of AI-powered decision-making, this talk will offer insights into how we can do more with less when fighting financial crime.\n\n***Beyond APIs: MCP Security for AI Integrations with Harsh Makwana****.*\nThe Model Context Protocol (MCP) is rapidly becoming the standard for LLM integration with external tools and data. However, this accelerated adoption has often sidelined crucial security hardening. This talk will directly address the inherent security challenges within MCP implementations, providing essential strategies to build robust, secure AI agents.\n\n**Speakers:**\n**Bahar Emami Afshar** is in the process of completing their Master\u2019s in Computer Science at the University of Ottawa, specializing in AI. During this time they worked under the supervision of Dr. Paula Branco and completed a research internship at H3M Analytics Inc. Their research focuses on explainable AI, anomaly detection, and label-efficient learning, with a particular emphasis on fraud detection and financial crime. Over the past year, Bahar has published several first-author papers exploring adaptive and efficient strategies for detecting fraud in low-label and imbalanced scenarios. Bahar is passionate about building intelligent systems that are more transparent, trustworthy, and impactful in real-world settings.\n\n**Harsh Makwana**, M.Eng, is an Application Security Consultant at Software Secured with over 3 years of experience in penetration testing. An alumnus of the University of Ottawa, Harsh is a general technologist with a strong interest in the advancements of both cybersecurity and industrial robotics. Outside of work, he enjoys exploring photography and illustration as creative pursuits."

This talk, \"Reducing Application Security Risk with ASPM (Application Security Posture Management),\" will explore the emerging role of ASPM in fortifying application security and accelerating DevSecOps and cloud native adoption by focusing on how to future-proof your approach for 2025 and beyond.\nSoftware development has undergone seismic shifts over the last 20 years: the Agile movement, the rise of DevOps and cloud native practices, and now the AI and generative development era. With AI code assistants and \u201cvibe coding\u201d on the rise, we\u2019re seeing faster delivery, along with new and complex risks. Over the last 10 years of the DevSecOps journey, shift-left has also achieved little success. Application Security needs a fundamental reset for the future. In this talk, we will discuss how modern approaches and technology innovations that are built to solve three of the biggest challenges in application security that must evolve for the AI Era \u2013 Speed, Coverage & Scale, and Context. We will explore three common scenarios:\n\n1\\. Inventory and Secure net new applications\n2\\. Reduce risk and volume of existing security backlog by prioritizing and fixing what matters\n3\\. Expand coverage to address emerging blind spots in AI\\-assisted application development\\."
